LETTERS TO ATTICUS X. 17

XVII

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

On the 14th of May Hortensius came to me, just Cumae, Ma3
as Ι had written my letter. I wish his conduct were 16, me. 49
always as it is now.1 You would never believe how
gushing he was, and Ι intend to take advantage of it.
Then Serapion came with a letter from you. Before
I opened it, I told him that you had written to me
about him before, as you had done. Then when I
had read the letter, Ι told him the rest in full detail,
and upon my word I like the man3 for I think him
to be learned and upright. Moreover I think Ι
will use his ship and make him my fellow-passenger.

Inflammation of the eyes often breaks out again,
not indeed very troublesome, but enough to prevent
my writing. That your health has recovered from
your old complaint and your new attacks I am glad.

I wish I had Ocella here: for it looks as if things
are going to be rather easier. Just now the equinox
is delaying me. It has been very boisterous. When
that is over, I only hope Hortensius may keep to the
same mind. So far he could not be more generous.

You wonder about the passport I mentioned, as if
1 hinted you were guilty of some crime. You say you
can’t discover how it came into my mind. For my
part since you wrote that you meditated leaving, and
I had heard that a passport was indispensable‚ Ι de-
cided you must have one: and also because you had
taken out a passport for the boys. That was the
reason for my opinion, but please write and tell me

² Or “ I wish he would always confine himself to writing.”
But the passage may be corrupt.
