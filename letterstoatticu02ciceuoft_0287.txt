LETTERS TO ATTICUS IX. 2

from anger and let us reflect that there is nothing

, left us now except what to me is least desirable—

Ι

Ιιΐῖιε for me, since the Adriatic is beset, I shall sail

Ξ by the lower sea, and, if it be difficult to start from
²· Puteoli, I shall seek Croton or Thurii, and like a

 

loyal and patriotic citizen play the pirate. Other
means of conducting this war I see none. We will
go and bury ourselves in Egypt. We cannot match
Caesar on land, and we cannot rely on peace. But
enough of this outcry.

Please entrust a letter to Cephalio about all that
has been done, and even about people’s talk, unless
men have become quite dumb. I followed your
advice, especially when I maintained in our conversa-
tion a proper dignity and persisted in my refusal to
go to Rome. For the rest please write to me in as
much detail as possible (for the worst has come to
the worst) what you approve and what you think,
though now there can be no doubt. But yet, if
anything comes into your mind, or rather whatever
comes into your mind, please write to me.
