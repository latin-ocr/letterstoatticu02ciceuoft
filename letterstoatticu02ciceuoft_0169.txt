 

LETI'ERS TO ATTICUS VIII. 12a

legions to march to that place: moreover Ι have
not been able to bring together more than fourteen
cohorts of them, because two were sent to Brun-
disium, and Canusium to my mind could not be left
without a garrison in my absence.

Hoping to collect larger forces Ι instructed D. Lae-
lius, that with your approval one of you should come
to me, and the other set out for Sicily with the force
you have collected at Capua and in the neighbour-
hood, and with Faustus' recruits 3 that Domitius with
his twelve cohorts should join up, and all the other
troops should concentrate at Brundisium, and from
thence be taken by sea to Dyrrachium. Now, since
at the present time I am no more able than your-
selves to go to Domitius’ assistance [and it remains
for him] 1 to extricate himself by the mountain route,
Ι must take steps that the enemy may not meet my
fourteen doubtful cohorts or overtake me on the
march.

Accordingly—and I see M. Marcellus and other
members of the House who are here approve-——I am
resolved to lead my present forces to Brundisium.
You I urge to concentrate all the forces you can
and to come with. them to Brundisium at the first
opportunity. I consider that the arms which you
meant to send to me should be used to arm your
troops. If you will have the remaining arms carted
to Brundisium, you will have done the state great
service. Please give these instructions to my sup-

orters. I am sending word to the praetors‚ P.
{upus and C. Coponius, to join you with whatever
soldiery they have.
