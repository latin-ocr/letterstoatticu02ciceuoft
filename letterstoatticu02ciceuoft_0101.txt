LETTERS TO A'ITICUS VII. 20—21

Appian troops. Caesar is said to be tearing along,
and is nearly on us, not to join battle—there is no
one to join it with—but to cut us off from flight.
Now, if it is to be in Italy, I am ready to die with
her—and on that Ι need not ask your advice: but if
the struggle is beyond her borders, what am I to do?
ΤΙιε winter, my lictors, the improvidence and neglect
of the leaders prompt me to stay: my friendship
with Pompey, the cause of the loyalists‚ the disgrace
of association with a tyrant‚ prompt me to fiee. One
cannot say whether that tyrant will choose Phalaris
or Pisistratus as his model. Please unravel this and
assist me with your advice. Though I suppose you
are in a warm corner in Rome, still help me to the
best of your ability. I will advise you if anything
new crops up here to-day. ΤΙιε consuls will arrive
on the 5th as arranged. I shall look for a letter

Ἰ every day: but answer this one as soon as you can.

I have left the ladies and the boys at Formiae.

February, as the consuls bade. Lentulus arrived late
in the day. The other consul had not arrived at all

μ on the 7 th : for on that day I left Capua and stayed at

Cales. On the 8th before daybreak I dispatch you
this letter from there. The discovery Ι made at
Capua was that no reliance is to be placed on the
consuls, and that no levy is being made anx where
