LETTERS TO ATTICUS VII. 1

Ι come back to Hirrus. You have begun to recon-
cile him to me ; accomplish it. Scrofa and Silius are
on your side. I have already written to them and to
Hirrus himself. For Hirrus had told them in a
friendly way that he could easily have prevented the
decree, but was reluctant; that, however, he had
sided with Cato, my very good friend, when the latter
recorded a vote complimenting me in the highest
termS. Hirrus added that Ι had omitted to write to
, him, though I had sent letters to every one else. He
was right. It was only to him and to Crassipes that I
’ did not write. So much for public life. Let us come
home.

I wish to dissociate myself from that fellow Philo-
timus. He is a veritable muddler‚ a regular Lartidius

“ A truce to what is past for all our pain.'’ 2

Let us settle what remains; and first this point,
which adds anxiety to my sorrow. This sum, I mean,
ἶ whatever it is, which comes from Precius, I do not
want mixed up with the accounts of mine of which
that fellow has the handling. Ι have written to
Terentia and to Philotimus himself that I shall deposit
with you any moneys I may collect, sor the equipment
of the triumph I anticipate. So I fancy there will be
no amour propre wounded : but as they like. Here is
another matter for your consideration—the steps 1
am to take to arrange this business. You outlined
η them in a letter dated from Epirus or Athens, and
I will support your plan.

² Taken by the older commentatore to be a Latin form of
· Λαερτιάδης (i.e. Ulysses); but the sense does not seem to
warrant thg comparison, which could only mean “ aa wily-
oeffiffisasgsiiviii, ll2; xiX, 65, “ Let bygones be bygones.'‘
