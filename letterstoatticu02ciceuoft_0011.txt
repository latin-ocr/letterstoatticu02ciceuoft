INTRODUCTION

Tms second volume of Cicero’s Letters to Atticus
embraces one of the most important epochs in
Roman history, the fall of the Republic in the
struggle between Pompey and Caesar. The storm
which had long been brewing broke just as Cicero
returned from Cilicia over the question of Caesar's

five years and he was then to be re-elected to the
consulship in 48 B.C. As the renewal dated from
March 1, 54 B.C.‚ his term of office would'naturally
expire on March 1, 49 B.c. ε but according to the rule
in vogue at the time of the reappointment he would
not be superseded until J an. l, 48 B.C., the date on
which he would enter on the consulship. He would
therefore hold office continually, and his enemies,
the Senatorial party, would have no chance of bring-
ing a prosecution against him, which might be fatal
to his career. But in 52 B.C. they had induced
Pompey to bring forward a new law by which ex-
magistrates did not proceed to a province as soon as
their office ended but after an interval of five years.
Consequently for the next five years special appoint-
ments had to be made by the Senate-for example
Cicero’s appointment to Cilicia—and, as they could
be made at any time, it would be perfectly easy to
supersede Caesar on March 1, 49, and secure his
prosecuffion, condemnation and downfall before he
could enter on the consulship.
