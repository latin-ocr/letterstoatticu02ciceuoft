LETTERS TO ATTICUS X. 9a—1o

which Ι assure you will be ours as soon as Caesar

Ἰ arrives, What your friends' hopes are, when they

have lost Spain, is more than Ι know3 and what

your idea is in joining them, when they have no
opes, is more than I can imagine.

What you hinted at without speaking plainly,
Caesar had heard, and as soon as ever he had said
η “ good day,'’ he told me what he had heard about
you. I said Ι knew nothing about itt but I asked
him to send you a letter as the best means of in-
ducing you to stay. He is taking me with him to
Spain. If he were not, I should have hurried to you,
before going to Rome, wherever you might have
been, and. should have pressed this view on you
personally and done all in my power to restrain you.

Once more and yet once more, Cicero, think before
’ you utterly destroy yourself and all your family: do
not wittingly and with your eyes open put yourself
in a position from which you see there is no escape.
But, if you are moved by the call of the conservative
’ party, or if you cannot endure the insolence and
ζ arrogant behaviour of certain persons, I think you
should choose some town remote from the war, until
the matter is settled: and settled it will be at once.
If you do that, I shall consider ou have acted
, wisely, and Caesar will not be offen ed.

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

How blind I am not to have foreseen it! I send Cumae,
= you Antony’s letter. Ι have often written to him May 3,
that Ι planned nothing against Caesar’s policy‚ that ime. 49
Ι was mindful of my son-in-law, of our friendship‚
