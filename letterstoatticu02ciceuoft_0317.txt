LETTERS TO A'ITICUS X. 8

ᾗ always adds that you think the same, and this is
ἶ what I have gathered myself from your letters, Ι

ἑ ῒίὲίῐὼ it is well for me to write to you what I think

The advice would be wise, it seems to me, only if
I meant to shape my course according to what hap-

on the wealth of private persons, the recall of exiles,

without pain friends whom Ι have defended or to
mix with them without shame? And what if even
that may not be allowed to me, for all I know? For
Caesar’s friends write me that he is not at all satis-
