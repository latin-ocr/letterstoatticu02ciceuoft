LETTERS TO ATTICUS VII. 12-13

Rome, he would have been of great service to our
cause. Loyalty it would have appeared had made
him regard his friend a traitor: it appears so as it is,
but it is of less use. For there is no cause to serve,
and Ι imagine that he is sorry at leaving Caesar,
unless perhaps the report is false. Myself Ι think
it true. -

And please give me a sketch of city affairs, though
according to your account you keep to your house.
Is Pompey missed? Does Caesar seem disliked?
What do you think about Terentia and Tullia?
Should they remain in Rome, or join me, or seek
some refuge? On these and any other topics pray
write to me, I mean write often.

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

¹ ³ In the matter of Vennonius I agree with you. Μεηίανηαε,

Labienus I consider a hero. There has been no Jan, 22,

- - ublic action of such distinction for a long time. If 13,c, 49
Ee has done nothing else, he has at least hurt Caesar’s

feelings. But I think he has served our main

Ἰ interests as well. I am delighted too with Piso. His

’ judgement on his son-in-law 1 should carry weight.

However, you see the nature of our struggle. It is

civil war, though it has not sprung from division

among our citizens, but from daring of one aban-

doned citizen. He is strong in military forces, he

atti-acts adherents by hopes and promises, he covets

the whole universe. Rome is delivered to him

stripped of defenders, stocked with supplies: one may

² Caesar.
