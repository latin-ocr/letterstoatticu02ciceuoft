LETTERS TO ATTICUS VII. 7

the people, the adoption of a patrician by a plebeian,
of that gentleman of Gades by the man of Mytilene}
And I should have to approve of the wealth of
Labienus and Mamurra and the gardens and Tusculan
'estate of Balbus. But the source of all these evils is
one. We ought to have resisted him when he was
weak: that would have been easy. Now there are
eleven legions, cavalry as much as he wants, the
northern tribes across the Po, the city riff-raff‚ all
the tribunes of the people, the young profligates, a
leader of such influence and daring. We must either
fight him or allow his candidature according to the
law. ‘⁴ Fight,’' say you, “ rather than be slaves.’'
The result will be proscription if beaten and slavery
even if one wins. “ What shall I do then? '’ What
> <the cattle do, who when scattered follow flocks of
their own kind. As an ox follows the herd, so shall I
“· J follow the “ right party‚'’ or whoever are said to be
“ the “ right party,” even if they rush to destruction.
’ sse best course in our straits is clear to me. No one

ι -; , can tell the issue of war: but every one can tell that,

if the right party are beaten, Caesar will not be more
merciful than Cinna in slaying the nobility, nor more
³ moderate than Sulla in robbing the rich. I have
discussed la haute politique long enough, and I would
’ do so longer, had not my lamp gone out. The end is
‘⁶‘ Your vote, Marcus Tullius.” I vote with Pompey‚
that is with Titus Pomponius.

Please remember me to Alexis, a very elever boy,
unless perhaps in my absence he has become a man,
as he threatened to do,

¹ Balbus of Gades was adopted by Theophanes of Myti-
lene, who had himself received the citizenship from Pompey.
