 

LETTERS TO ATTICUS X. 9

ζ’ without saying exactly what it is, though you disclose
, sufficiently what kind of an act it is, Ι write this on
Ι the spot. In the name of your fortunes and your
, children, I beg and beseech you, Cicero, not to take
' any step that may endanger your life and safety.
ζ For I call gods and men and our friendship to wit-
ness that Ι told you before, and that it was no casual
, warning that Ι ave you, but certain information,
after I had met aesar and found out what his view
would be, if he won the victory. If you imagine
that he will maintain his present policy of letting his
, adversaries go and making peace, you are mistaken3
he is meditating and even proclaiming nothing but
cruelty and severity. He left Rome in anger with
the Senate: these recent vetoes have clearly pro-
voked him: you may take my word for it there will be
no chance of begging off. Then, if you have any care
for yourself, you only son, your house and what
hopes you have left, if I and your excellent son—in·
law have any influence with you—and you ought not
to wish to spoil our fortunes—then do not compel us
to hate or relinquish a cause, in whose victory our
safety lies, or to harbour unnatural wishes for your
destruction. Finally consider this: any offence there
may have been in your hesitation, you have already
, given. Now it is the height of folly to side against
Caesar in his hour of victory, when you refused to
attack him while his fortunes were doubtful; and to
join in the flight of those, whom you would not
’ follow when they stood their ground. Beware lest
for fear of showing too little zeal for the “ better
party,'' you take too little care in choosing the better
course. But, if I cannot persuade you entirely, at
least wait till it is known how we get on in Spain,
