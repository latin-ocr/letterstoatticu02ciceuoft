LETTERS TO ATTICUS X. 3a—4

IIIa

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

On the 7th of April I dictate this letter, the Arcanum,
second on the same day, and yesterday Ι dispatched April 7,
a longer one in my own handwriting. It is said you B.C. 49
have been seen in the Regia} and I don't blame you,
since Ι laid myself open to the same blame. But I
await a letter from you. I don’t see what news I
l can expect3 but still, even if there is none, I wish

you would just tell me that.

Caesar has written to excuse me for not coming to
X Rome, and says that he takes it in good part. Ι am
not concerned at his saying that Titinius and Servius
have complained to him for not allowing them the
same privilege as he did to me. What fools they
, are! They send their sons to besiege Pompey, and
themselves hesitate to enter the House. However,
’ Ι send you a copy of Caesar's letter.

CICERO To ATTICUS, GREETING.

Ῑ have received a lot of letters from you on the Cumae,
same day, all of them written with care and one, April 14,
which is as big as a book, worth reading several B.c. 49
- times, as I am doing. Your labour has not been in
’ vain: you have gratified me very much. And so I
beseech you continue to write as often as you can,
so long as it is possible, that is, so long as you know
where I am. And as for our daily lamentations let
us make an end of them once for all, if we can, or at

² The official residence of Caesar as Pontifeae maximus.
