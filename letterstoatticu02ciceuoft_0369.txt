CICERO'S LETTERS

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

I got your sealed document, which Anteros brought. Epirus,
It gave me no information about my private affairs. Ι January,
am exceedingly distressed about them, because Philo- 13.C. 48
timuS, who managed them, is not at Rome, nor do I
know where in the world he is. And my whole hope
of preserving my credit and private property lies in
your tried and proved kindness towards me. If in
this last desperate crisis you still show that, Ι shall
face the dangers which I share with others more

By a bill of exchange for that amount it will be easy
for you to maintain my credit. Unless I had thought
Ι were leaving it all square (trusting one, whom you
have long since known I ought not to have trusted),
I should have delayed a little longer and not left my
private concerns embarrassed. The reason why Ι
have been rather long in writing to you about it, is
that Ι was a long time in gathering what was to be
feared. Again and again I beseech you that you
undertake to protect me in every way, so that, sup-
posing my present associates are spared, I may
along with them remain unembarrassed and put
down my safety to your kindness.
