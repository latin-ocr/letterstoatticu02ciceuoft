(which is not a difficult accomplishment)‚ but did not
in the latter. It is a difficult art to rule a republic

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

I have not had what you say is your experience 3- Formiae,
“ as often as my hopes revive.'' Only now are mine Feb. 15, ac,
reviving a little, and especially over letters from 49
Rome about Domitius and the squadrons of Picenum.
Things have become more cheerful in the last two
dayS. I have given up my preparation for flight. I

, spurn Caesar's threat: ‘⁴ If I shall meet thee here
ἒ to—morrow morn.” 1 The news about Domitius is

good, that about Afranius is splendid.

Thanks for your very friendly advice, not to com—
mit myself more than Ι can help. You add a caution
against showing a leaning towards the wrong party:
well, Ι confess Ι may seem to. I refused to take a
leading part in civil war, so long as there were nego-
tiations for peace, not because the war was unjust,
but because former action of mine in a still juster
cause did me harm. Ι had no desire at all to excite
the enmity of a man to whom our leader offered a
second consulship, and a triumph too with the ful-
some flattery “ on account of your brilliant achieve-
ments.'' I know whom I have to fear and why.
