INTRODUCTION

under Afranius and Petreius at Ilerda, and gained
the whole peninsula. While the issue was still un-
certain in Spain, and indeed things looked un-
favourable to Caesar, Cicero screwed up his courage
and joined Pompey in Epirus. Meantime Sardinia
was occupied by Caesar’s adjutant P. Valerius and
Sicily gave way to Curio. The latter passed on to
Africa, where after some success he met with defeat
and death at the hands of J uba. It was not till
January 48 B.C. that Caesar effected a landing in
Epirus, where he proceeded to surround Pompey’s
camp near Dyrrachium: but his lines were broken
through and he sustained a slight defeat. He re-
tired towards Thessaly and there in August won a
decisive victory over Pompey at Pharsalus. Pompey
fled to Cyprus and thence to Egypt, there to meet
his death. The rest of the party split up, some
going to Africa to carry on the war, others to Greece
and Asia to make terms for themselves with Caesar.
Cicero after a violent quarrel with his brother at
Patrae returned to Brundisium, and there spent
many miserable months wondering what his fate
would be when Caesar returned. His missortunes
were increased b a rupture with his wife Terentia,
and the unfaith ulness and general misconduct of
his son-in-law Dolabella, which forced him to pro-
cure a divorce for Tullia. And there this volume
leaves him, moaning.
