LETTERS TO ATTICUS VII. 18

It escaped my memory to write to you about
Dionysius before: but my determination is this, to
await Caesar's answer, so that, if Ι return to Rome,
Dionysius may await me there ; but, if there is delay,
then I would summon him. I am quite aware of
what he ought to have done when Ι took to flight,
what was proper for a scholar and a friend, especially
when he had been asked to do it: but I do not expect
much from a Greek. But please see, if Ι have to
summon him, which I hope I shall not, that I may
not be troubling a reluctant man.

My brother Quintus is anxious to give you a draft
on Egnatius for the money he owes, and Egnatius is

ᾇ willing and has plenty of cash3 but when the times
’ are such that Q. Titinius,1 whom I see often, declares

⁸ he has no money to get along with, and yet has told his
debtors that they may let their debts stand over at the
same rate of interest as before, and when L. Ligus too
is said to have taken the same stepS, and Quintus at
the present time has no money in hand, and is unable
to borrow from Egnatius or to raise a new loan any-
where‚ he is surprised that you have not taken into
account our national straits. Though Ι observe the
saying wrongly ascribed to Hesiod “ Hear both
sides,'’ 2 particularly in the case of yourself, whom Ι
have always found considerate, still I was affected
by his grievance. You ought to know his grievance,

’ such as it is.
