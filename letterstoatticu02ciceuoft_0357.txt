LETTERS To ATTICUS x, 15

I await a letter from you meanwhile. Servius’ advice
has not been helpful. All sorts of bars meet us in

sorry he was ever a consul. What a lowborn spirit!
He is said even to have strengthened Antony's reso-
lution to prevent my departure: so that his own
conduct Ι suppose may appear more honourable.
Antony started for Capua on the loth, sending word
that shame prevented his visiting me, because he
thought Ι was annoyed with him. So I shall go, and
openly as you advise, unless hope of playing a more
important part shall offer. But that can scarcely
occur so soon. Allienus the praetor thought one of
his colleagues would be chosen‚1 if I were not. Let
it be anyone they like so long as it is some one.

As to your sister, Ι approve. As for young Quintus,
Ι am doing my best, and I hope things are better.

q As for my brother Quintus, you must know that he is

taking extraordinary pains to borrow money to settle

’ his debt; but so far has squeezed nothing out of L.
Ἴ Egnatius. Axius is modest about the ς,43100 2: for

he often requested in his letters that I should pay
Gallius as much as he wanted. Even if he had not
written, could Ι have helped it? Ι have often pro-
mised indeed3 but he wanted so much at once.
They should have helped me rather in my difficulties,
confound them. But Ι will write of this another
time. Ι am glad you are rid of your ague, and
Pilia too. While bread and provisions are being put
on board, Ι am going off to my estate at Pompeii.
Please thank Vettienus for his trouble. If you can
find a messenger, give me a letter before I leave.
