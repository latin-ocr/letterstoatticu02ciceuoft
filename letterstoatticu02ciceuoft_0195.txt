 

LETTERS TO ATTICUS IX. 1-—2

, of the Republic, do not like my staying in Italy, and
that they sit half the day over their festive boards
making caustic remarks about me.

So I must depart, and, to be a good citizen, wage
war on Italy, kindle against myself again the hatred of
the disloyal which had died down, and follow the plans
of Lucceius and Theophanes. For Scipio can be said
to set out for Syria, his allotted province, or to ac-
company his son—in-law, which is an honourable
excuse, or to flee from Caesar's anger. The Marcelli
would of course have stayed, had they not feared the
sword of Caesar. Appius has the same reason for
alarm, and additional reason through a fresh quarrel.
Except Appius and O. Cassius all the others hold
military commands, Faustus being proquaestor. I am
the only one who could go or stay as Ι like. Besides
there is my brother, whom it is not fair to involve in
my trouble. With him Caesar will be even more
angry, but Ι cannot induce him to stay behind. This
sacrifice Ι will make to Pompey, as loyalty bids. For
no one else influenees me, neither talk of loyalists—
for there are none—nor our cause, which has been
conducted in panic and will be conducted in disgrace.
To one man, one only, I make this sacrifice, though

ἢ he does not even ask it and though the battle he is

fighting is, as he says, not his own but the State's.

’ Ι should much like to know what you think about

ἰ crossing into Epirus.
