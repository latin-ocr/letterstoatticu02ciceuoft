LE'ITERS To ATTICUS VIII. 13—14

nothing at all but their lands, their little homesteads
and their tiny hoards. And see how public opinion
. has changed. They sear the man they once trusted,
and adore the man they once dreaded. It pains me to
think of the mistakes and wrongs of ours that are re-
sponsible for this reaction. Ι wrote you what I
{bought would be our fate, and I now await a letter

CICERO ΤΟ ATTICUS, GREETING.

I have no doubt my daily letter must bore you, Formiae,
especially as I have no fresh news, nor can I find any March, 2
new excuse for a letter. If I should employ special B.C. 49
messengers to convey my chatter to you without
reason, Ι should be a fool: but I cannot refrain from
entrusting letters to folk who are bound for Rome,
especially when they are members of my household.

Believe me, too, when I seem to talk with you, I
have some little relies from sorrow, and, when I read
a letter from you, far greater relies. I am quite
aware that there has been no time, since sear drove
me to ssight, when silence and no letters would have

¹ been more appropriate, for the good reason that there

is no fresh news at Rome, nor here—two or three
days’ journey nearer Brundisium. The issue of this

ἓ first campaign will turn entirely on the action at

Brundisium: and 1 am on thorns to hear the result.
However, all will be known by the 7th. On the
noon of the day (that is the 21st of February), on
the morning of which Pompey lest Canusium, I see
that Caesar set out from Corfinium. But Caesar
marches in such a way, and so spurs his men with
largess, that I sear he may reach Brundisium sooner
