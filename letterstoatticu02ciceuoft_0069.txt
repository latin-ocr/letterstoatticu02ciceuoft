LETTERS TO ATTICUS VII. 10—11

X

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

Ι have suddenly determined to leave town before Near Rome,
daybreak, so that Ι may escape sightseers and gossipS‚ Jan 17 or
especially with my bay-decked lictors. For the rest, 18, B.C. 49
what to do now or later, upon my word, I do not
know: I am so upset by our rash and lunatio policy.

What advice can I offer you, when it is to you I look
for advice? I know not what plan Pompey has made
or is making: so far he is cooped up in the towns,
paralysed. If he makes his stand in Italy, we shall all
be together: if he retires, it will be a matter for de-
bate. So far certainly, unless I have lost my wits‚

, his policy has been rash and foolish. Please write to

ᾗ me osten, just what comes into your head.

CICERO ΤΟ ATTICUS, GREETING.

What in the name of wonder is this? What is In Campa-
happening? I am in the dark. People say, “ Cingulum nia, Jan.
is ours, Ancona is lost, Labienus has deserted from 17—22, B.C.
q Caesar.’' Are we talking of a Roman officer or of 49
, Hannibal? Wretched madman never to have seen
² ‘the shadow even of right! Yet all this, he says, is
= τ, done to support his honour. Can there be honour
without honesty: and is it honest to retain an army
Α without sanction, to seize the cities of your country
that you may strike the better at her heart, to eon-
* trive abolition of debts, the restoration of exiles, and
Ἴ ⁴ scores of other crimeS‚
