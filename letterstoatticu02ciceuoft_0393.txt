LETTERS TO ATTICUS XI. 8

VIII

CICERO ΤΟ ATTICUS, GREETING.

Though of course you see for yourself in what Brundisium
distress Ι am, you will learn more about it from Dec. 18,
Lepta and Trebatius. Ι am paying very heavily for B.c. 48
my rashness, which you want to persuade me was
prudence: and I don’t want to stop you arguing that
it was and writing to me to that effect as often as
possible. For your letters afford me a good deal of
relief under the present circumstances. You must
use your utmost endeavour with those who are my
supporters and have influence with him—Balbus and
Oppius especially—to make them write about me as
strongly as possible. For I hear that I am being
attacked by some who are with him, and also by
letter. Their attack must be met, as the importance
of the matter demands. Fufius, a very bitter enemy
of mine, is there. Quintus sent his son not only to
make peace for himself, but to accuse me. He keeps
saying that I am trying to set Caesar against him,
though Caesar and all his friends deny it. And he
does not cease, wherever he is, from heaping all sorts
of abuse on me. It is the most surprising thing that
ever happened to me and the bitterest of all my
present sorrows. Those who reported the matter to
Ἰ me professed to have heard it from his own lips,

’ when he was slandering me at Sicyon in the hearing of
many. You know his way ; indeed you may have had
some personal experience of it. Now it is all turned
¹ on me. But Ι increase my own sorrow, and yours
too, by speaking of it. So I return to my first point.
Take care that Balbus sends some one expressly for
