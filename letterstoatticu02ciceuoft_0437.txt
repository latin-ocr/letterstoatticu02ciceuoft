ξ LETTERS To A'ITICUS x1. 23

3 think of my poor girl, both as regards the point
ι about which I wrote lately—making some arrange-
j ment to avoid destitution-and also as regards the
ι will itself. The other thing too I wish I had
ζ attended to before; but I was afraid of every-
thing. In this very bad business there was nothing
better than a divorce. Ι should have done some-
thing like a man, either on the score of his can-
celling of debts or his night attacks on houses, or
Metella or all his sins together: I should not have
lost the money, and Ι should have shown some manly
spirit. Ι remember of course your letter, but Ι
remember the circumstances too: still anything
would have been better than this. Now he seems
to be giving notice of divorce himself ; for I have
heard about the statue of Clodius. To think that a
son-in-law of mine above all people should do such
a thing as that, or abolish debts! So Ι agree with

ou we must serve a notice of divorce on him. Per-
⁴ haps he will ask for the third instalment of the
ς dowry. So consider whether we should wait for a
move of his or act first.1 If Ι can possibly manage
it, even by night journeys, I will try to see you.
= Please write to me about this and anything else it
ἐ may interest me to know. Farewell.

³ ¹ If Dolabella started the divorce proceedings, he could
, not claim the rest of the dowry, and would have to refund
what had already been paid. Π Tullia began them, part at
= least of the dowry would remam with him, unless she could
prove misconduet.
