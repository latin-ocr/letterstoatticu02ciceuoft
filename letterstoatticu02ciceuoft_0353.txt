CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

⁴ What a wretched life this is! and to be so long Cumae,
afraid is more wretched than the very thing one fears ! May 3, 13.c.

often tiresome by keeping me awake. So please col-
lect all the consolation you can and send it to me——not
from philosophy or books—I have plenty of that, but I
find somehow that the cure is too weak for the disease.

’ and he also tells me there is excellent authority for

send me, if you get it, and such like topics. Anyhow
in a few days something must be heard.
But to return to Servius. We deferred all our
conversation to the next day: but he is reluctant to
leave Italy, declaring he would much rather die in
