LETTERS TO ATTICUS VIII. 2

man of little standing. You may say that I am too. I
say nothing of myself ε Ι leave that to others. Who
has standing here? All you loyalists stay at home,
and will continue to stay there. Who failed me in the
old days? Who supports me now in this war, as I
must call it ?

So far Vibullius' achievements have been fine.
You will see that from Pompey’s letter. Vide the
passage marked.¹ You will see Vibullius' own opinion
of Pompey. My point is that I can gladly die for
Pompey's sake—there is no one I hold dearer 3 but not
in that way. In him I see no hope for the safety of the
state. You express a view different from your usual
view, that I must even leave Italy, if he does. That
course seems to me of no advantage to the state or
to my children, and, moreover, neither right nor
honourable. But why do you say, ‘⁶ Will you be able'
to see a tyrant ''? As if it mattered whether I hear of
him or see him, or as if I wanted a better example than

Ῑ Socrates, who never set foot out of gate during the
¹ reign of the Thirty tyrants. Besides I have a special

reason for staying. I wish I could talk it over with
ymXfter writing this letter on the l7th, by the same
lamp as that in which I burned yours, 1 set out from
Formiae to go to Pompey, and I may be of use, if the

'ialk is of peace: but, if of war, of what use shall
be?

¹ The διπλ* was a marginal mark of this shape > used in
MSS. to mar a special passage or in dialogus to indicate
the appearance of a new speaker.
