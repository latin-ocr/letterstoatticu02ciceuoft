LETTERS TO ATTICUS VIII. 16

these, to banish me, while they remain at horne?
Stil] whoever they are “ 1 fear the Trojans.” Yet Ι Iliad vi, 442
see clearly with what a prospect I set out, and I join
myself with a man ready to devastate our country

rather than to conquer its oppressor, and Ι look to
serve a tyrant. And indeed on March 4, the date of

this letter, I am expecting every moment some news
from Brundisium. Why do I say “ some news,” when
it is news of his disgraceful ssight, and the route by
which the victor is returning and the direction in
which he is moving. On hearing that, I think of

going to Arpinum, if Caesar comes by the Appian
way.
