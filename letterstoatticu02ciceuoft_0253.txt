LETTERS TO ATTICUS IX. 11

He seemed to me, I do declare, moderate and
sensible: certainly he has always been thought to be
in favour of peace. How he disliked this present
pass! How he seemed to fear these times damne'es, as
you call them! In the course of a long talk I showed
him Caesar’s letter to me, of which I sent you a copy
before, and I asked him to explain what Caesar meant
by writing that he wished “ to take advantage of my
advice, my inHuence, my position and my help of all
sorts.'’ Matius replied that undoubtedly Caesar
wanted my help and influence to make peace. Would
that I could succeed in carrying through some poli-
tical compromise in this miserable state of affairs!
Matius himself declared that Caesar had that feeling,
and promised that he would help such a course.
However the day before Crassipes had been with
me, and he said that he had quitted Brundisium on the
6th of March and left Pompey there3 the same tale
was brought by those who quitted the place on the
Sth. All of them, and among the rest Crassipes, who
was quite capable of observing what was going on, had
the same story, threatening words, breach with the
loyalists, hostility to the municipalities, nothing but
proscriptions‚ nothing but Sullas. How Lucceius
talked, all the Greeks and Theophanes too! Never-
theless the only hope of safety lies in them, and I am
on the watch and take no rest and long to be with

’ the most uncongenial associates to escape the plague

 

here. For what crime do you think that Scipio will
stick at, or Faustus and Libo, when their crpeditors
are said to be selling them up, and what do you sup-
pose they will do to the citizens when they win?
g How pusillanimous Pompey is! Tbey say that heis

thinking of Egypt and Arabia Felix and Mesopotamia
