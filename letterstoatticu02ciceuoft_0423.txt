LETTERS TO ATTICUS Xhl. 17-17a

distressful fate, and that this should happen through
no fault of hers, but through my own grave error.

though I see you are ready to offer it, nor any coun-

CICERO ΤΟ ATTICUS, GREETING.

Ι am thinking of sending my son with Sallustius to Brumli.‹,=1'umB
Caesar. As for Tullia, I see no reason for keeping June 14,
her with me any longer when both of us are in such B.c. 47
sorrow: so I am going to send her back to her mother,
as soon as she herself will allow me. In return for
the letter which you wrote in a consolator-y style,
please consider that I have made the only answer,

ῃ which, as you yourself know, was possible.

You tell me Oppius has had a talk with you: and
ζ what you say agrees well enough with my suspicions
³ of him. But Ι feel sure that party 1 can never be con-
vinced that their actions can possibly win my ap-
proval, whatever I may say. However, I will be as
moderate as I can: though, what difference it makes
to me, if Ι do incur their enmity‚ Ι cannot conceive.

I see you have a good reason for not being able to
come to me: and Ι am very sorry that is so. There
is no news that Caesar has left Alexandria; and it is
well known that no one at all has left that place since
the l5th of March, and that he has despatched no
letters since the 13th os December. So you see it
was quite untrue about the letter dated Febr. 9,
