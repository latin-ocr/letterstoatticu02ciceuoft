LETTERS TO ATTICUS VIII. 12b

XIIb

GREETINGS FROM CN. MAGNUS PROCONSUL ΤΟ
L. DOMITIUS PROCONSUL.

I am greatly astonished that you send me no Luceria,
letters, and that Ι am kept informed of the political Feb. 11 or
situation by others rather than yourself. With 12, B.C. 49
divided forces we cannot hope to eope with the
enemy: united, I trust we may do something for
the safety of our country. Wherefore, as you had
arranged, according to Vibullius’ letter, to start
with your army from Corfinium on the 9th of
February and to come to me, I wonder what reason
there has been for your change of plan. The reason
mentioned by Vibullius is trivial, namely that you
were delayed on hearing that Caesar had lest
Firmum and arrived at Castrum Truentinum. For
the nearer our enemy begins to approach, the
quicker you ought to have joined forces with me,
before Caesar could obstruet your march or cut me
off from you.

Wherefore again and again I entreat and exhort
you—as I did in my previous letter—to come to
Luceria on the first possible day, before the forces
which Caesar has begun to collect can concentrate
and divide us. But, if people try to keep you
back to protect their country seats, I must ask you
to dispatch to me the cohorts, which have come
from Picenum and Camerinum abandoning their own
interests.
