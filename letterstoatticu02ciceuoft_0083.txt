LETTERS TO ATTICUS VII. 13a—14

authority, and is palming off some chance conversa—
tion as a commission.

Labienus, my hero, arrived at Teanum on the
22nd, where he met Pompey and the consuls. As
soon as I have positive news, Ι will inform you of
what they have said and done. Pompey set out from
Teanum for Larinum on the 23rd. He spent that day
at Venafrum. At last Labienus has given us some en-
couragement, but I have no news from this quarter.
Rather I expect news from you of Caesar’s doings,
how he takes Labienus' desertion, what Domitius is
doing among the Marsi, Thermus at Iguvium, and P.
Attius at Cingulum, what is the city's feeling, and
what are your views as to the future. Please write
me often on these topics, and give me your opinion
about my women—folk and your own intentions.

χ Were I writing myself this letter would have been
3 longer, but I dictate it owing to inflammation of the
l eyes.

slight inflammation of the eyes. L. Caesar brought
Caesar’s ultimatum to Pompey on the 23rd, while
Pompey was at Teanum with the consuls. His condi-
tions were accepted with the reservation that he should
withdraw his garrison from the towns he has occupied
outside his own province. That done, they said, we
would return to Rome and settle business in the
House. I hope for the present we may have peace:

Caesar is rather sorry for his madness, and Pompey
