LETTERS TO ATTICUS IX. 12

sorrow, so that now Ι would choose the end of
Mucius.l But how honourable, how simple, how
clearly thought out was your advice as to my land-
route and my sea-route and my meeting and talk with
Caesar! It was equally honourable and prudent.
Your invitation, too, to Epirus, how kind and generous
and brotherly it is!

As for Dionysius, I am surprised. I held him in
greater honour than Scipio held Panaetius, yet he has
most foully mocked at my bad fortunes. I hate the
fellow and I always shall. I wish I could pay him
out. But his own character will do that.

I beseech you now give the greatest consideration
to my proper course. An army of the Roman people
invests Gnaeus Pompey. It holds him hedged by
trench and mound and keeps him from ssight. Yet we
Ἰ 'live and Rome is standing, the praetors preside in

court, the aediles make preparations for t e games,
the conservatives are booking their profits, and I sit
still! Am I to try to cross the sea like a madman, to
beg the country towns to be loyal ? The loyalists will
not follow me, the irresponsible will deride me, the
revolutionarieS, especially now they are armed and
victoriOUS, will lay hands of violence upon me. What
do you think then? Have you any plan to end this
life of misery? Now I feel grief, now I am in agony,
when somebody thinks me wise because I did not go
with Pompey, or lucky perhaps. Ι think the opposite.
For never did I wish to share a victory of his ; I should
have wished rather to share his defeat. Why should
I entreat a letter from you now, your kindneSS, your
good sense? It is all over. Nothing can help me
