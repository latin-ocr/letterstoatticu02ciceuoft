 

LETrERS TO A'ITICUS X. 16

23rd of April, as Curio has informed me by letter. I
only hope Cotta may hold Sardinia, as they say, for
there is a rumour to that effect. If that happens,
what a reflection on Cato!

To lessen suspicion of my journey and intentioris
1 started for my place at Pompeii on the l2th of
May to stay there while the necessary provisions
were made for my voyage. When Ι arrived, I was
told the centurions of the three cohorts here wished
to visit me the next day. That was what my friend
Ninnius said—that they wished to hand over them-
selves and the town to me. But Ι lest the next
morning before daybreak‚ so that they should not see
me at all: for what was the use of three cohorts‚ or
more indeed? And what was our equipment? Ι
pondered too over the matter of Caelius when I read
it in your letter, which I received on the same day
as Ι arrived at Cumae. It was possible too that it
was a mere ruse, so I did away with all grounds of
suspicion. But, while I was on my way back, Hor-
tensius came, and turned out of his way to greet
Terentia, and he had spoken of me with much cour·
tesy. I think I shall see him soon, for he has sent a
servant to announce his coming. This is better
behaviour than that of my fellow augur Antony, who
carries an actress in a sedan among his lictors.

As you have lost your quartan fever and have not
only thrown off your new malady but also your cold,
you must present yourself before me sound and fit
in Greece. Meanwhile drop me a. line.
