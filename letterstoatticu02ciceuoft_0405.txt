 

LETTERS TO ATTICUS XI. 12

beseech you to aequit him of doing anything to dis-
turb my sense of your claims on me or to lessen my
affection for you, and rather to regard him as the
main factor of our union and the companion, not the
leader, in my departure. And therefore in all other
matters you will give him all the credit that your ’
own kindness and your mutual friendship demands,
What Ι earnestly beg you again and again is, that
you will not let me stand in his light with you.”

So, if I ever do meet Caesar, though I have no
doubt that he will be lenient to Quintus and that he
has already made that plain, Ι shall behave as I
always have behaved. But, as I see, what I ought
to be most anxious about is Africa, which you say is
daily growing stronger, though only to the extent
of raising hopes of a compromise rather than a
victory. If it could only be true! But I read the
signs quite differently, and Ι think you agree with
me, and only say the contrary to hearten me, not
to deceive me, especially as Spain too has now
joined Africa.1

You advise me to write to Antony and others. If
you think it necessary, please do it for me, as you
have often done besore; for I cannot think of any·
thing worth writing. You hear I am less broken·

, spirited3 but can you believe it, when you see that

to my former troubles are now added my son-in-
law's fine doings?2 However, pray do not cease

² After his victory in Spain 111 49 Β.ο., Caesar left Q·

’ Cassius Longinus in command there; but Spain went over
ἢ to Pompey and both Longinus and his successor, O. Tre-

bonius, were driven out.
² Dolabella as tribune endeavoured to introduce a bill for

Ἴ the relies of debtors, which caused riots.
