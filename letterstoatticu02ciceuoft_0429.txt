LETTERS TO ATTICUS XI. 20-21

things Ι have to sear from the Quinti and others : and
Caesar's own regal concessions are again in his own
ς power to revoke. He has even pardoned Sallustius,
⁴ Indeed he is said not to deny anyone, and that
in itself arouses a suspicion that he is only defer-ring
ἵ investigation. M. Gallius, son of Quintus, has given
” back his slaves to Sallustius. He came to transport
the legions to Sicily, and he says Caesar is going
from Patrae to Sicily. If he doeS, Ι shall come
nearer Rome, and Ι wish Ι had done so already.
Ι am expecting eagerly your answer to my last
request for advice. Farewell.
August 15.

CICERO To ATTICUS, GREETING.

On August 25 Ι received a letter from you dated Brundisium,
Aug. 19, and, on reading it, the sorrow which Aug, 25,
possessed me long ago at Quintus’ shameful con- B.C. 47
5 duct, but which I had now laid aside‚ was re-

’ awakened in all its force. Though you could not
possibly have helped sending me that letter, Ι
ὲ wish it had not been sent.

For the points you mention about the will, please
see what is to be done and how. About the money,
Terentia has written to me just what I suggested to
you before, and, if I need it, I will draw on the sum
you mention.

Caesar probably won’t reach Athens by the lst of

413
