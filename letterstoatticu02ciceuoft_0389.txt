LETrERs To Armcus xl. 7

but if anything does turn up, as in this present case.
It used to be said that 1 ought to have gone with
Pompey: but now his death tends to absolve me
from blame for neglecting my duty in that case. But
where I am thought to have been most lacking is in
not going to Africa. My view was that barbarian
auxiliaries drawn from a most deceitful race were not
the proper persons to defend the State, especially
against an army which had won so many victories.
That view may not meet with approval; for I hear
that many patriots have arrived in Africa, and I
know there were some there before. This is a point
that really bothers me: and here again I must trust
to luck, that there may be some of them, or, if such

’ a thing is possible, all of them, who put safety first.

For, if they hold fast and succeed, you can see what
a position I shall be in. You will say ‘⁴ How about
it, if they are defeated? '’ That is a more honourable
blow. This is what tortures me. However, you
have not told me why you do not prefer Sulpicius’
policy to mine. It may not be so glorious as Cato'st

but it is at any rate free from danger and regret.
³ The last case is that of those who stayed in Achaia.
Even they are in a better position than I am, be-

 

cause there are many of them together, and, when
they do come to Italy, they will go straight home.

ι Please continue your efforts to ameliorate my
Β position and to win over as many people as possible
² to approval.

You explain why you do not come. Yes, Ι know

5 your reasons and think it is to my interest that you
ζ should stay where you are, for one thing that you
¹ may be able to carry out any necessary negotiations
· about me with the proper persons, as you have done.
