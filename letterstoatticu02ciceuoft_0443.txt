LETTERS TO ATTICUS XI. 24—25

a crumb of comfort: but, if, as I see is the case,

there is nothing, write and tell me that. If I hear

anything first I will write to you. Farewell.

CICERO To ATTICUS, GREETING.

Ι can quite believe what you explain at some Brundisium,
length in your letter, that no advice of yours can July 5, mc.
assist me: and certainly there is no consolation 47
which can relieve my sorrow. For none of my mis-
fortunes has come upon me by fate—that would have
been endurable—-but I have brought all on myself
by my mistakes and my mental and bodily afflic-
tionS‚ which I only wish my nearest and dearest had
thought fit to remedy. So, as there is no hope of
any advice from you or any consolation, I will not
ask for them henceforth: only please do not cease
from writing to me anything that may occur to you,
when you have anyone to send it by, and so long as
there is anyone to send it to3 which will not be long.

Tbere is a rumour, though not a very certain one,
that Caesar has left Alexandria. It came first from
ι a letter of Sulpicius, and has been confirmed by all
⁴ Subsequent messengers. Whether to prefer it to be
false or true, I don’t know, as it does not matter to
me.

As I told you already about the will Ι should like
it to be preserved in a safe place.1 I am worn out
and harassed by the infatuation of my unhappy
daughter. I don’t think there ever was such a child

¹ This seems to be the sense, though the reading is doubtful.
