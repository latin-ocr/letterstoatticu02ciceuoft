LETTERS TO ATTICUS VIII. 11b

M. CICERO IMPERATOR GREETINGS To CN. MAGNUS
PROCONSUL.

On the 15th of February I got your letter at For· Formiae,
miae. Ι gather that matters in Picenum were much Feb. 16,
more satisfactory than I had heard, and am glad to B.C. 49
learn of the bravery and energy of Vibullius.

So far Ι have stayed on this coast where Ι was
given the command, but I have kept a boat ready.

For the news and my fears were such that I felt Ι
must follow any plan you should make. But now
your influence and your policy have encouraged me, I
will stay in the coast districts and Tarracina, if you
think that the district can be held. The towns,
however, are without garrison, for there is no member
of the Senate in the district except M. Eppius, a
man of foresight and energy, whom I desired to stay
at Menturnae. The gallant and influentia] L. Torqua-

tus is not at Formiae, but I fancy has set out to join
ou.
y In entire accord with your latest instructions, Ι
went to Capua on the very day you left Teanum Sidi-
cinum. For you had desired me to take part with M.
Ἴ Considius the propraetor 1n iooking after things there.
On arrival I found that T. Ampius was holding a levy
with the greatest energy, and that the troops raised
were being taken over by Libo, a local man of energy
and influence. I stayed at Capua as long as the con-
suls. Once again in accordance with instructions
from the consuls Ι went to Cap ua for the 5th of Feb-

ruary. After a stay of three days I returned to
Formiae.
