LETTERS TO ATTICUS XI. 6-7

ς Ι never had any doubt. For despair of his success
had so completely taken possession of the minds of
all the kings and peoples, that I thought this would
hap ppen to him, wherever he might go. I cannot
help feeling sorry for his fate, for Ι knew him to be
a man of honour and high moral principle. Am I to
. condole with you about Fannius? He used to speak
Δ virulently of you for staying in Rome. L. Lentulus,

’ you know, had promised himself Hortensius' house,
Caesar’s gardens, and a place at Baiae. Precisely
⁷ the same is taking place on this side too, except that
ἲ 011 the other there was no limit. For they counted
every one who stayed in Italy as an enemy. But I

ἵ would rather speak of this sometime when Ι 3111 less

ζ worried.

I hear my brother Quintus has set out for Asia to
make his peace. About his son I have heard nothing;
but ask Diochares, Caesar’ 5 freedman, who brought
those letters from Alexandria. I have not seen him.
He is said to have seen Quintus either on the way,
or was it already in Asia? I am looking forward to

, 3 letter from you, as the occasion demands. Please
try to get it conveyed to me as soon as possible.

November 27.
