LETTERS TO ATTICUS X. 13

³ how he plays the statesman. He summoned by letter
Α ten leading men and the board of four from the muni-

cipal towns. They came to his country house in the
morning. First he slept till nine. Then, when he
, heard the men had come from Naples and Cumae (for

Ἰ Caesar is angry with them), he bade them return on

the next day, saying that he wished to take a bath

³ and a laxative. This he did yesterday. But to-
’ day he has arranged to cross to Aenaria. He is

promising the exiles 1 that they shall return.
But let us pass over this and talk about ourselves.

’ Ι got a letter from Q. Axius. As for Tiro, thanks.

Ι like Vettienus. Ι have repaid Vestorius. Servius

1 is said to have stopped at Menturnae on the 6th of

May. To-day he will stop with C. Marcellus in his
villa at Liternum. To-morrow early he will see me,
and will give me a subject for a letter to you. Just

j now Ι can find nothing to write. I am much aston-

ished that Antony has not even sent a messenger to
me, especially when he has paid me much attention.
I suppose he has some more truculent order about

Ἴ me. He does not wish to refuse me to my face, but

I was not going to ask the favour, nor, if I had got it,
should I have believed him. However Ι will think
out some plan. Let me know if anything has happened

in Spain ; fdr now there is time for news to have come,

and everybody awaits it with the idea, that, if all go
well there, there will be no more trouble. But I do
not think the business is over, if Spain be kept, nor
yet hopeless, if it be lost. Silius and Ocella and the
rest I suppose are detained. I see that you too are

hindered by Curtius, though I think you have a

, passport.
