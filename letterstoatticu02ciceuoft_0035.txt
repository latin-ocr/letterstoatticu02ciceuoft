LE'ITERS TO ATTICUS VII. 2-3

festival. Forgive me, Ι cannot and I will not bear
it.

I long to answer all your letters3 but there is no
need, for soon Ι shall see you. Still I must tell you
about Chrysippus—the conduct of that other fellow,
a mere mechanic‚ excites my surprise leSS, though it
could not have been more scandalous. But Chrysip-
pus, whom Ι was always glad to see and held in
honour, because he had a smattering of culture‚⁴fancy
him deserting my son without my knowledge! Ι can
put up with other things, though I hear of plenty, I
can even put up with embezzlement; but I cannot
put up with his ssight. It is the most scandalous
thing Ι ever heard of. So Ι have taken a leaf from
Drusus' book, when, in his praetorship, as the story
goes, a man, who had been manumitted, refused to
take the oaths he had promised: and I have denied
that those fellows ever were freed by me, especially
as there were no legal witnesses to the transaction.
Take it any way you will: I will abide by your
decision.

The only one of your letters, which Ι have not
answered, is the most eloquent of them all, deal-
ing with the country' s peril. I have no answer to
make. I am very much upset. But the Parthians,
whose sudden retreat left Bibulus half dead with’
fright, have taught me not to be much alarmed at

anything.

CICERO To A'r'rlcus, GREETING.

On the 6th of December I came to Aeculanum, Trebula„
and there Ι read your letter, which Philotimus handed Dec. 9,
to me. I was pleased at the first glance to see it was ac. 50
