LETTERS TO A'ITICUS IX. 4

one who tries to abolish it may not rise too high
himself. Whether one ought to assist one’s country,
when under a tyranny, by seizing opportunities and
by argument rather than by war. Whether one is

i doing one’s duty to the State, if one retires to some
¹ other place and there remains inactive, when there

is a tyranny3 or whether one ought to run every
risk for liberty. Whether one ought to invade the
country and besiege one's native town, when it is
under a tyranny. Whether one ought to enrol one-
self in the ranks of the loyalists, even if one does
not approve of war as a means of abolishing tyranny.
Whether one ought in political matters to share the
dangers of one‘s benefactors and friends, even if one
does not believe their general policy to be wise.
Whether one who has done good service for his
country, and by it has won ill-treatment and envy,
should voluntarily put himself into danger for that
country, or may at length take thought for himself
and his dear ones and avoid struggles against the
powers that be.

By employing myself with such questions and dis-
cussing the pros and cons in Greek and Latin, I
divert my thoughts a little from my troubles and at
the same time consider a subject which is very perti-
nent. But I sear you may find me a nuisance. For,
if the bearer makes proper headway, it will reach
you on the very day you have your attack of agne.
