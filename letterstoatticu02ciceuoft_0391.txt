LETTERS To ATT1cth XI. 7

And in the first place Ι should like to call your
¹ attention to this point. I think there are many who

3 have reported or will report to Caesar either that I
g am repenting of my policy or that I do not approve
’ of recent events. Though both are true, they say it
ζ out of spite against me, not because they have seen

it to be so. Everything rests on the support of

ἰ Balbus and Oppius, and on their confirming Caesar’s
ζ good will to me by sending him frequent letters.
' Please do your best to bring this about. The other

reason why I prefer you not to leave is that you say

’ἶ Tullia begs for your assistance. What a misfortune?
ξ What can I say? What can I even wish? I will
³ cut the matter short, for tears spring to my eyes at

once. I give you a free hand: do you look to it.
Only take care that nothing is done under the present
circumstances to offend the great man. I crave your

> pardon. Tears and sorrow prevent me from dwelling
’ any longer on this topic. Ι will only add that
’ nothing makes me feel more grateful to you than

your love for her.

You are quite right to send letters for me to any-
one to whom you think it necessary. I have met a
man who saw young Quintus at Samos and his father
at Sicyon. They will easily obtain their pardon.

,. Ι only hope, that, as they will see Caesar first, they

will think fit to further my case with him, as much as

’ Ι should have furthered theirs‚ if I had been able.

 

You ask me to take it in good part, if there is
y anything in your letters that wounds my feelings.
I promise you to take it in the best possible part,
¹ and I beg you to write everything quite openly, as
you do, and to do so as often as possible. Farewell.
