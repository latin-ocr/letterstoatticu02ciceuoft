LETTERS To A'I’TICUS XI. 2

C1CERO ἸῸ ATTICUS, GREETING.

I received your letter on the 4th of February ‚Eand irus,

utter want you depict. On what are the rents of my
farms being wasted? That 500 guineas 2 of which
you write, no one ever told me that it had been kept
back out of the dowry, for Ι would never have allowed

I cannot write to you about them for sorrow and
tears. Of the money I had in Asia Ι have called in
nearly half. It would appear to be safer where it is
than with the tax-collectors.

As for your exhortations to be of good courage, I
wish you could find some reason why I should be so.
If, on the top of my other sorrows, there comes that
which Chrysippus said is under consideration (you
gave me no hint), I mean the confiscation of my town
