LETTERS TO A'ITICUS X. 12a-13

I often reflect about Caelius; and if Ι have such
an opportunity, I will not let it go. I hope Spain
’ is safe. The action of the Massilians is praise-
= worthy in itself, and is a proof to me that things are
going well in Spain. They would have been less
bold, isit were otherwise, and they should know, for
they live near and are watchful. You are right to
remark the expression of popular feeling in the
theatre. Even the legions which Caesar got in Italy
seem to me to be very dislo al to him. However he
is his own worst enemy. Y>ou are right to fear that
he may run amuck. Assuredly he will, if he loses
’ hope. That is all the more inducement for me to do
= something in the spirit of Caelius, and Ι hope with
better luck. But everything in due course3 and,
whatever it be, I will inform you forthwith. I will do
all for young Quintus that is necessary, and will
undertake the task not only of Arcadia but of the
whole Peloponnese.1 He is able, if only he had
character. However, if he has none so far, he may
get it, or virtue is not teachable, and that I can
¹ never believe.

CICERO To ATTICUS, GREETING.

Your letter was very pleasing to my daughter and Cumae,
of course to me, for your correspondence always brings May 7, luc,
a gleam of hope. So please write, and, if you can be 49
hopeful, don't fail to be so. Don’t be too much afraid
of Antony’s lions.2 He is a jovial fellow. Just hear

ἔ guffarih and Pliny state that after Pharsalia Antony had
a chariot drawn by lions: but from this passage it appears
that the story was current earlier.
