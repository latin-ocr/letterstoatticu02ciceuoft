LETTERS· TO ATTICUS XI. 24

write that my fortune and yours are at Tullia’s ser-
vice, I believe you as to yours, but what can there
be of mine? Now as to Terentia, Ι omit lots of other
things, for what can one add to this? You wrote to
her to remit me by bill of exchange 5:100, saying
that was the balance. She sent me 80 guineas,1
adding that that was all the balance. If she purloins
so trifling an amount from so small a total, you can see
what she has been doing in the case of larger sums.
Not a trace of Philotimus as yet: nay, he has not

ἦ even informed me by letter or messenger what he
Ξ has done. Those who come from Ephesus say they
ξ saw him there going into court about some lawsuits

of his own, which possibly—indeed in all probability
——are deferred till Caesar's arrival. So I suppose
he either has nothing which he thinks he need hurry
to bring to me, or I have sunk as low in my mis-

, fortunes that, even if he has, he does not take the

trouble to bring it until he has finished all his own
business. And that causes me considerable annoy-
ance, but not so much as I think it ought. For Ι
don’t think anything matters much less to me than
what answer he brings back from that quarter. Why,
I am quite sure you know.

You advise me to mould my looks and words ac-

. cording to circumstances. It is difficult‚ but I would

 

put a rein on myself‚ if I thought it mattered to me
at all. You say you think the African business can
³ be arranged by an interchange of letters : Ι wish you
’ would say, why you think so: for I can't imagine
any reason for thinking it possible. However please
write to me, if there is anything that would give me

² 12,000 and 10,000 sesterces respectively.
