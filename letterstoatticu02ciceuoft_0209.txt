 

LETTERS TO ATTICUS IX. 5

thought that the day of the battle of Alia was blacker
than the day of the capture of Rome, because the
capture was but the consequence of the battle (and
· so the former day is still a black letter day and the
latter is commonly unknown), so Ι too was angry in
recalling his errors of the last ten years, which in-
cluded the year os my affliction, when he gave me no
help, to put it mildly‚ and recognizing his foolhardi-
ness, sloth and carelessness at the present time.
But all this Ι have forgotten. It is his kindness I
think of, and I think of my own honour too. Ι
understand, later indeed than I could have wished,
from the letters and conversation of Balbus, but I
see plainly, that the sole object is, and has been
from the beginning, the death of Pompey. So Ι say
the same as Achilles to his mother, when she said
‘⁸ For after Hector’s death thy doom is fixed,'’ and

he replied, ‘⁴ Then let me die, since I have failed to Iliad xvm, 964>

save my friend.’'

And in my case it is not only a friend but a bene-
factor, a man so great and championing so great a
cause. Indeed Ι hold that life should be paid for
the kindnesses that he has done me. But in your
loyal party I have no confidence: nor do I even
acknowledge any allegiance to them now. Ι see
how they surrender and will surrender themselves to
Caesar. Do you think that those decrees of the
towns about Pompey’s health were anything com·
pared with their congratulatory addresses to Caesar?
You will say, ‘⁸ Tliey are terrorized.'' YeS, but they
themselves declare that they were terrorized on the
former occasion. But let us see what has happened
at Brundisium. Perhaps from that may spring
different plans and a different letter.
