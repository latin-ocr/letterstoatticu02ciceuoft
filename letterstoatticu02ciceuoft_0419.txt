LETTERS TO ATTICUS XI. 16

x turn—whereas he is said to be still fighting—still I

think the business will be settled before he does

; You say, however, that some feeling of pleasure
was aroused among the loyalists when they heard of

* this letter. Of course you do not omit anything in

which you think there is the least consolation, but Ι
cannot bring myself to believe that any of the loyal-

hitch at Alexandria improved their case and ruined
mine. So I still make the same request of you as in

letter. I would, if the letter gave me any pleasure‚

though some one has written to me saying: ‘⁴ Con-
ἶ sidering the evil days, Ι am pretty comfortable at

Patrae, and I should be more so, if your brother

’ί would speak of you as I should like to hear him.'’

of Baetica, which forced Cassius to leave the province,

ι the mutinous state of the army in Italy.
