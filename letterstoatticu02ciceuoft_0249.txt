LETTERS TO ATTICUS IX. 10

In the same letter there is another passage ε “ Nothing
is left for Pompey but ssight, in which Ι do not think
and never have thought that you should share.’'
This counsel you unroll in detail in your letter
dated the 22nd of February: ‘⁸ If Μ’. Lepidus and
L. Volcacius stay, Ι think you should stay, provided,
if Pompey wins safety and makes a stand anywhere,
you should leave these times damne'es, and rather
share defeat with him than share Caesar’s sovereignty

, in the mire that will be.” You argue at length in

support of this view, then at the end you say : “ What
if Lepidus and Volcacius depart? I am quite at a
loss. So I shall think you must face the event and
abide by what you have done.” If you had any doubt
then, you certainly have no doubt left now, as those
two persons remain in Italy. Next, when the flight
was actually made on Feb. 25 2 ‘⁴ Meantime I have no
doubt you should stay at Formiae. It will be most
convenient there to await the event.'' On the lst
of March, when Pompey had been four days at
Brundisium: “ Then we shall be able to debate, not
indeed with a free hand but assuredly less hampered‚
than if you had shared his plunge.'’ Next on the
4th of March, though you scribbled a line on the eve
of your fever bout, nevertheless you say this: ‘⁴ Ι will
write more to-morrow‚ and answer all your questions.
But Ι maintain this, that I am not sorry for advising
you to stay, and, though very anxious, still, because I
fancy it is better than ssight, I stick to my opinion
and am glad that you have stayed in Italy. ’ When
1 was already tortured with sear that my conduct
was disgraceful on the 5th of March you write:
“ However I am not sorry that you are not with
Pompey. Hereafter, if need arise, it will be easy,
