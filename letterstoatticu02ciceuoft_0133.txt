LETTERS TO ATTICUS VIII. 4-5

height of ingratitude, and ingratitude includes all
sins, But enough and more than enough of this.

I have a boat ready. Still Ι wait for a letter from

You know that at Sulmo C. Atius Paelignus opened
the gates to Antonius, though he had five squadrons,
that Q. Lucretius has escaped from the place, and
that Pompey has gone to Brundisium, deserting
Domitius. We are done for.

nature. I enclosed in your packet a strong letter
for him. I should be glad to have it returnedz and
