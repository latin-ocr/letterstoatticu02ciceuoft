LETTERS TO ATTICUS VII. 23

XXIII

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

On the evening of the 9th of February, I got a Formiae, the
letter from Philotimus, declaring that Domitius has a evening qs
reliable force, the cohorts from Picenum under the Feb. 9 or the
command of Lentulus and Thermus have joined morning qf
his army, Caesar can be cut off and fears the con· Feb. 10,
tingency, and the hopes of loyalists at Rome have B,c. 49

been restored, and those of the other party dashed.
I am afraid this may be a dream3 but still the news
revived Μ’. Lepidus, L. Torquatus and C. Cassius the
tribune of the plebs—-for they are with me, that is at
Formiae. I sear the truer version may be that we
are now all practically prisoners, that Pompey is
leaving Italy, pursued it is said by Caesar. What a
bitter thought! Caesar pursue Pompey! What,
to 'slay him? Woe is mel And we do not all
throw our bodies in the way! You too are sorry
about it. But what can we do? We are beaten,
ruined and utterly captive.

Still the perusal of Philotimus' letter has caused
me to change my plan about the women-folk. I
wrote you I was sending them back to Rome: but it
has come into my mind that there would be a deal of
talk, that I had now come to a decision on the political
situation; and that in despair of success the return of
the ladies of my house was as it were one step towards
infflff{Essrssamffsniffssfsssysssssffiol&3523ss ffitl‘ffi
certainty of flight, seeing that it would avail nothing
to State or Pompey, for whom I would dutifully and
gladly die. So I shall stay, though life—.
