LETTERS TO ATTICUS VIII. 120

CN. MAGNUS PROCONSUL SENDS GREETING ΤΟ
L. DOMITIUS PROCONSUL.

M. Calenius has brought me a letter from you Luceria,
dated the 16th of February, in which you express Feb. 16,
the intention of watching Caesar and hurrying to B.C. 49
join me in Samnium, if he shall begin to march
against me along the coast: but, if he linger in your
neighbourhood, you say you wish to oppose his
nearer advance.

To my mind your policy is ambitious and brave,
but we must take great care that, if divided‚ we
may not be outmatched by the enemy, since Caesar
has numerous troops and in a short time will have
more. A man of your judgement ought to bear in
mind not only the size of Caesar's present array
against you but the number of infantry and cavalry
that he will soon collect. Evidence of that contin-
gency is in the letter which Bussenius dispatched to
me, and it agrees with the missives from others in
stating that Curio is concentrating the garrisons
which were in Umbria and Etruria and marching
to join Caesar. With these forces combined, though
one division may be sent to Alba, and another advance
on you, and though Caesar may refrain from the
offensive and be content to defend his position, still
you will be in a fix, nor will you be able with your
following to make sufficient head against such num-
bers to allow of your sending out foraging parties·

Therefore I beg you earnestly to come here on the
first opportunity with all your forces. The consuls
have decided to do the same. 1 have instructed
