enemy can concentrate all his forces. The levies
cannot reach here at an early date, and, even if they
were concentrated‚ you must see how little trust can
be put in troops, which do not even know one another
by sight, when facing a veteran army.

and rapine, he will be the darling of those who dreaded
him most. The people of the country towns and the
far-mers talk to me a great deal. They care for
