LETTERS TO ATTICUS IX. 2a-3

the Spains from Pompey, occupying Asia, Sicily,

Africa, Sardinia, and forthwith pursuing Pompey into

Greece.” So Ι must set out to take part not so much

ὲ in a war as in a ssight. For I can never put up with

the talk of your friends, whoever they are, for
certainly they are not what they are called, loyalists.
Still that is just what I want to know, what they
do say, and I beg you earnestly to inquire and
inform me. So far I know nothing of what has
happened at Brundisium. When I know, I shall
form my plans according to circumstances and the
moment3 but I shall use your advice.

CICERO To ATTICOS, GREETING.

The son of Domitius went through Formiae on the Formiae,
8th of March hastening to his mother at NapleS, March 9,
and, when my slave Dionysius inquired particularly 13.c. 49
from him about his father, he sent me a message
that he was outside the city. But I had heard that
he had gone either to Pompey or to Spain. What
the fact is, I should much like to know, for it has a
bearing on the point Ι am now considering: if it is
certain that Domitius has found no means of depar-
ture, Pompey may understand that my own departure
from Italy is difficult‚ seeing that it is now beset
with troops and garrisons, and especially in the
winter season. For, were it a more convenient time
of year, one could even cross the southern sea.

Now there is no choice but the Adriatic, to which
passage is barred. So please inquire both about
Domitius and about Lentulus.
