LETTERS TO A'ITICUS XI. 3-4

’ to your kind care, and to the consideration and
desire of poor Tullia, whose interests would have
been better consulted‚ if originally Ι had discussed
our safety and fortunes with you in person rather
than by letter.

You say there is no trouble threatening me especi-
ally in this public missortune. There is a little con·
, solation in that, but there are many circumstances
’ special to me, which you must see are very serious
¹ and might easily have been avoided. However they
will be less serious, if, as hitherto, they are lightened
by your care and management.

ΤΙιθ money is with Egnatius. Let it remain there,
so far as I am concerned: for things cannot last long
μ as they are, so that Ι shall soon know what is most
necessary. However, I am in want of everything‚
»f because the man I am with 1 too is in great straits and
I have lent him a large sum of money, thinking that,
when things settle down, that will bring me honour
ὲ as well as profit. Please, as before, if there are any
’ persons to whom you think I ought to write, do it for
me. Pay my greetings to your family. Take care of
your health. Above all, as you say, make every care-
ful provision that nothing may be wanting to my
daughter, on whose account you know Ι am very

unhappy.
June 13, at the camp.
