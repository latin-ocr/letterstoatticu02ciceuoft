CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

Ι think all your letters reached me, but the first Cales, Jan.
out of proper order, the others as they were dis· 28, 13.c. 49
patched by Terentia. About Caesar's ultimatum‚
the arrival of Labienus, and the reply of Pompey and
the consuls, Ι informed you in my letter of the 26th

, of January from Capua, and I threw in a deal of
“ other information besides. Now we have two things

to wait for, first what Caesar will do on receipt of the

= terms given to L. Caesar to convey to him, and

. secondly what Pompey is doing now. Pompey indeed

¹. writes to me that in a few days he will have a strong
,, force, and he encourages me to hope, that, if he
³1 . enters Picenum, we shall return to Rome. Labienus
ι ⁷ accompanies him, confident in the weakness of

 

Caesar’s forces. His arrival has much encouraged
Pompey. The consuls have ordered me to go to
Capua by the 5th of February.

Ι set out from Capua for Formiae on the 28th of
- January. On receipt of your letter at Cales on that
day about three o’clock I write this by return. As
for Terentia and Tullia I agree with you, and I have
’ written to them to consult you. If they have not yet
started, there is no reason for them to bestir them-
selves, till we see how things are.
