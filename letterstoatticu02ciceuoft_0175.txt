LETTERS TO ATTICUS VIII. 12c—12d

M. Tuscilius to tell you that we must beware
lest the two legions without the cohorts from
Picenum come within sight of Caesar. Accordingly
do not be disturbed if you hear of my retreat in
the face of Caesar’s possible advance, for I con-

⁴ sider that I must take every step to avoid being

trapped. The season of the year and the spirit of
my troops prevents me from making a camp3 nor
is it wisc to collect the garrisons from all the towns,
lest room for retreat be lost. So Ι have not mustered
more than fourteen cohorts at Luceria. The con-
suls will bring in all their garrisons to me or start
sor Sicily. We must either have an army strong
enough to allow of our breaking through the enemy’s
lines, or get and hold localities we can defend. At
the present moment we have neither of those advan-
tages: a large part of Italy is held by Caesar, and
our army is neither so well equipped nor so large as
his. We must therefore take care to look to the
main issue. Again and again I beg you to come to
me as soon as possible with all your forces. Even
now the constitution may be restored, if we take
common counsel in our action. Division means
weakness: of that I am positive.

After I had written my letter Sicca brought me
a dispatch and message from you. Ι fear I cannot
comply with your request for assistance, because I
do not put much trust in these legions.
