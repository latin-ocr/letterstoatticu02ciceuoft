LETTERS TO ATTICUS X. 8a-8b

⁵ and your daughter Tullia, that queen among women,
; and you are rated so highly by all of us, who, I dare
swear, care almost more than you do for your dignity
and position. However, Ι considered that it was no
part of a friend to be unmoved even when scoundrels
talked, and I have been more particular, because I
thought that a harder task was laid upon me by our
disagreement, which sprang more from jealousy on my
’ part than from wrong on yours ; for I want you to con-
vince yourself that no one is dearer to me than you,
except Caesar, and at the same time I am positive that
Caesar reckons M. Cicero highly among his friends,
So my dear Cicero Ι beg you not to commit yourself
= and not to rely on the honour of a man, who for the
sake of conferring a kindness first did you a harm,
and on the other hand not to flee from a man, who

although he will not love you, which is out of the
¹ question, will always wish you to be safe and in high
r distinction.
f “ I have taken the trouble to send you Calpurnius,
η an intimate friend of mine, that you may know I am
greatly concerned for your life and position.’'

On the same day Philotimus brought me a letter
from Caesar of which this is a copy:

 

g “ CAESAR IMPERAToR 'ro CICERO 1MPERATOR, anamma.

“ Although I had concluded that you would do
i nothing rashly or imprudently‚ nevertheless I have
ἶ been so stirred by what people say that I thought it
ξ best to write to you and ask you in the name of our

goodwill to each other not to go anywhere, now that

ῑ fortune inclines my way, where you did not think it
