LETTERS TO A'ITICUS X. 16

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

I had just sent a letter to you about a number of Cumae, May
matters, when very early in the morning Dionysius 14, B.c. 49

if he had corne in the spirit you described. For the
letter I got at Arpinum said that he was coming and
would do whatever Ι wanted; and I wanted or rather
longed that he should be with me. It was because
he had flatly refused to do so, when he carne to my
ς villa at Formiae, I used to write to you about him
rather bitterly. However, after the first greeting‚
ξ he said, to put it shortly, that I must excuse him and
that business prevented his going with me. I said
’ little in reply, but Ι was greatly hurt, for I understood
that he looked down on my fortunes. You may be
astonished, but you must know that this is one of the
> greatest sorrows Ι have suffered in this crisis. I hope
¹' that he may be a friend to you. When I wish that,
’ I wish you prospersty, for just so long he will be your
friend.

My plan, I hope, will be free from risk, for I have
kept the matter a secret, and, as I think, I shall not
be watched very keenly. Only let the voyage be as
good as Ι want, and all precautions that foresight can
suggest will be taken. While I am here, please
write not only anything you know or hear, but even
what you foresee.

trouble—and, if he had held it, all loyalists would
have flocked to him—sailed from Syracuse on the
