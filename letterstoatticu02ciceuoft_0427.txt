XIX

CICERO TO A'r'rlcus, GREETING.

As I had a chance of giving a letter to your men, Brundisium,

ζ I did not miss it, though Ι have nothing to say. You July 22,
' are writing less often than you used to do and less B.c. 47

fully, I suppose because you have nothing that you

Ῐ think Ι should be glad to read or hear. However

please write, if there is anything of any kind what-
ever. There is one thing that Ι do long for, any
possibility of a peace z myself I have no hope of such
a thing: but, as you sometimes give a slight hint,
you compel me to have some hope of what I hardly
dare long for.

Philotimus is said to be coming on the l3th of
August. Of Caesar I have no further news. Please

f answer my former letter. I only want time enough
:¹ to take some precaution now in my missortunes, cs

Ι have never taken any before. Farewell.

J uly 22.

menno 'ro A‘r‘ricus, GREETmo.
On the l4th of August there arrived from Seleucea Brundisium,

ι Pieria C. Trebonius after 28 days’ journey: and he Aug. 15,
³ said he had seen young Quintus at Antioch in Caesar ’s Ec, 47

J train with Hirtius. They had got what they wanted

. about my brother without any difficulty at all. Ι

should feel more joy at that, if what I have got myself
gave me some sure ground for hope.1 But there are

¹ Or, as Tyrrell, “ is the granting of such petitione

λ afforded, in my opinion, any sure basis ior hope.”
