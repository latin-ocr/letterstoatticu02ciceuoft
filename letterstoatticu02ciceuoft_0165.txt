LETTERS TO ATTICUS VIII. 12

blame for cowardice and the charge of treachery to
boot, Ι refused to take over Capua in its unprepared
state. Nor am I to blame, when, after L. Caesar and
L. Fabatus had brought terms of peace, I took pre-
cautions not to incur the enmity of a man to whom
Pompey was offering the consulship and a triumph,

view not only glory, but also some measure of safety.
However, I make no conditions : please give me your
candid opinion. And please use your best energies to
