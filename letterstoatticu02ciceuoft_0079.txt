LETTERS TO ATTICUS VII. 13

fear anything from a man who regards her temples
and her homes not as his native land, but as his
loot. What he will do, and how he will do it, in the
absence of House and magistrates, Ι do not know.
He will be unable even to pretend constitutional
methods. But where can our party raise its head
or when? You, too, remark how poor a soldier our
leader is; why, he did not even know how things

criticism, if Ι leave them in Rome, when the loyal

careful what you do, as he writes to me. For your
