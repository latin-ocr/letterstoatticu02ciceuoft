intend to do, what is their present attitude, whether
they blame or are annoyed with anyone—why do I
say anyone ?—I mean Pompey. Pompey does not
hesitate to put the whole blame on Domitius, as can

copy. So please consider these points, and, as I wrote
you before, kindly send me that volume On Concord,
by Demetrius of Magnesia, which he sent to you.

As Ι considered that with divided forces we could Luceria,
be of no service to the state and no protection to Feb. 17 or
one another, I sent a dispatch to L. Domitius to 18, B.c. 49

he was dubious about himself, he should send me the
nineteen cohorts, which as a matter of fact were
on the march to me from Picenum. My fears have
been realized. Domitius has been trapped and is
not strong enough himself to pitch a camp, because
he has my nineteen and his own twelve cohorts
scattered in three towns (for some he has stationed
at Alba and some at Sulmo), and he is unable to free

numerous and of such importance from the danger
of a siege, and I cannot go to their assistance,
because I do not think that I can trust these two
