LETTERS To ATT1cUS xl. 12-13

doing what you can to hearten me, that is writing to
me, even if you have nothing to say. For a letter
from you always brings me something.

Ι have accepted Galeo’s legaey. Ι suppose it only

required a simple form of acceptanee,1 since none
was sent to me.

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

I have not received any letter from Murena’s Brundisium,
freedman as yet. It was P. Siser who delivered the March 9( ?)‚
one I am answering. You speak of a letter from B.c. 47
Servius' father, and you tell me some say that Quin-
tus has landed in Syria! neither is true. You want
to be informed how those who have come here feel
or felt towards me. I have not found any ill-disposed:
but, how important that is to me, I am sure you can
imagine. To me the whole state of affairs is insuffer-
ably painful; and most of all that Ι have got myself
into such a ease, that the only things that can be of
any use to me are precisely what I have always
wished not to happen.

They say the elder P. Lentulus is at Rhodes, the
ἶ younger alitflelfiiriarssldriaft andnit is cciertain {2th tC. Chas-

sius as e o es or exan ria. uin us as
· written to apologize to me in terms more much irri-
tating than when he was abusing me most violently.

ff For he says that he understands from your letter
‘ that you were annoyed with him for writing

² cretio = the formal acceptance of a legacy, and cretio
= simplex apparently means that no restrictione on the form
¹ of acceptanoe were laid down in the will.
