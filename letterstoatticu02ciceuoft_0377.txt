LETTERS TO A'ITICUS XI. 4-5a

· property did not sell. So please see to her support
yourself. As to the estate at Frusino, if only Ι am
to enjoy the fruits, it will be convenient for me.
You say I owe you a letter. Well, I am hindered
by want of matter, having nothing worth writing3 for
nothing that happens and nothing that is done has

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

You ask what new moves have been made. Isi- Dyrrha-
„ dorus will tell you. I don't think the rest of the task chium, June
’ will be any more difficult. Please pay attention to 15 ιο 19,
, what you know is my greatest wish‚ as you say you are ac, 48
doing. I am overwhelmed by care, and that brings
with it also great bodily infirmity. When that has
passed, I shall go to the man who is conducting the
’ business and who is in high hopes.1 Brutus is
friendly3 and takes a keen part in the cause.

That is all that I can prudently commit to paper.
Farewell. About the second instalment of Tullia’s
dowry, pray consider carefully what ought to be
done, as I said in the letter, which Pollex took.

² Le. Pompey, who had won a temporary success by
piercing Caesar’s lines.
