LETTERS TO ATTICUS VII. 7

his advisers have determined to send me to Sicily, be-
cause I still have military powers. That is a muddle-
headed plan.l For neither has the House decreed,
nor the people authorized me to have military power
in Sicily. If the state delegates the appointment to
Pompey, why should he send me rather than any
unofficial person ? So, if this military power is going
to be a nuisance, Ι shall get rid of it by entering the
first city gate I see. As for your news that there is a
wonderful interest in my arrival and that none of the
“ right or right enough party '’ doubt as to my future
action, Ι don’t understand your phrase “ the right
party.’' Ι don't know of such a party, that is if we
look for a class3 of course there are individuals.
But in political splits it is classes and parties we want.
Do you think the Senate is “ right,'' when it has left
ζ our provinces without military rule? For Curio

‘⁷ could never have held out, if there had been negotia-

tions with him-—a proposal rejected by the House,

5 which left Caesar without a successor. Is it the tax-

collectors‚ who have never been loyal and are now
very friendly with Caesar? Or is it the financiers or
the farmers, whose chief desire is peace? Do you
f suppose they will fear a king, when they never de-
clined one so long as they were left in peace? Well
‘³ then, do Ι approve of the candidature of a man who
keeps his army beyond the legal term? No, not even
of his candidature in absence. But when the one
privilege was granted, the other went with it. Do Ι
¹ then approve of the extension of his military power
for ten years, and that carried as it was carried?
³ Then I should have to approve of my own banish-
ment, the throwing away of the Campanian land on

¹ Abdera was the classic-al Gotham.
