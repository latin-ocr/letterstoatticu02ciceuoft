LETTERS TO ATTICUS X. 4—5

ΤΙὶε suspicion of domestic treachery and of the talk
with Hirtius has been removed. How I hope young
ς Quintus is worthy of his family, and how Ι keep
ι urging m self to note the points in his favour! But
' need he ave visited Hirtius? There is something
ζ in the tale, but I hope it may not prove of much
[ consequence. Still I wonder he is not back yet.
¹ But we shall see about this.
Please introduce Terentia to the Oppii: for there
is only one danger in Rome now.¹ As for me, give
i me the benefit of your advice as to whether I am to
{⁷ go to Regium on foot or to embark straight from
here, and on all the other points too, as I am staying
here. I shall have something to write as soon as Ι
have seen Curio. Please keep me posted up in news
about Tiro's condition, as you have done.

CICERO To A'r'rICUs‚ GREETING.

About the whole of my plans Ι have written to Cumae,

you before, as I think, exactly. Of the day I can April 16,
say no more for certain than this, that it will not B.C. 49
be before the new moon. Curio’s conversation on
the next day had practically the same gist‚ except
that he showed still more frankly that he could not
’ see an end to this state of things.
As for your commission about the control of
¹ Quintus, you are asking for the moon.² However I
ἱ ¹ The Oppii were moneylenders, and, if the reading unum
is right, Cicero must mean that- lack of obtaining ready
mgnnggsetahgsgvrglxy ganfigrfizllgloitgegmcle to a Spartan envoy
in Herodotus 1, 66, Ἀρκαδίαν μάἶτεῖς, μέ α μάἶτεῖς, οὗτοι δώσω,
“ Thou askest for Arcadia. 'Tis muc thou askest for. Ι
will not give it.'’
