LETTERS TO ATTICUS IX. 6

are 30,000 men, two consuls, tribunes and the
senators who were with him, all accompanied by
wives and children. He is said to have embarked
on the 4th of March. From that day there have
been northerly winds. They say he disabled or
burned all the ships he did not use.''

On this matter a letter has been received at Capua
by Lucius MetelluS, the tribune of the plebs, from
Clodia, his mother-in-law, who herself crossed the
sea. Ι was anxious and distracted before, naturally
enough under the circumstances, when I could find
no solution of affairs. But, now that Pompey and
the consuls have left Italy, I am not only dis-
tracted‚ but Ι blaze with indignation. ‘⁴ Steady my

heart no more, but wild with grief.” Believe me, 11iadx,91

I say I am no longer responsible, so great the shame
I seem to have incurred. To think that in the first
place I should not be with Pompey, whatever his
plan, nor again with the loyalists‚ however rashly they
have mismanaged their cause! Particularly when
those very people, whose interests kept me cautious,
my wife, my daughter and the boys, preferred that
Ι should follow Pompey's fortunes‚ and thought
Caesar's cause disgraceful and unworthy of me. As
for my brother Quintus, whatever I thought right,
he agreed to, and he followed my course with perfect
contentment.

Your letters I am reading now from the beginning
of the business. They afford me some little relief.
The first warn and entreat me not to commit myself.
The later ones show you are glad I stayed. While I
read them, my conduct seems to me less discreditable ;
but only so long as Ι read: afterwards up rises sorrow
again and a vision of shame. So 1 beseech you, Titus,
