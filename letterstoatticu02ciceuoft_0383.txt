LETTERS TO ATTICUS XI. 6

ὲ but the cruellest thoughts were entertained about
“· you personally. So Ι shall never regret my resolve3

but I do regret my plan of action. I wish I had

· settled down in some town, till Ι was called for.

There would have been less talk about me, less pain
for me; this particular regret at any rate would not

, be worrying me. To remain inactive at Brundisium

is annoying from every point of view. And how can
I go nearer to Rome, as you advise‚ without the

, lictors given me by the people? ΤΙιθγ cannot be
57 taken from me without depriving me of my rights.
ζμ Only lately, as Ι was approaching Brundisium, Ι made
them mix with the crowd with nothing but sticks in

x their hands for sear the soldiery might attack them:

 

ever since Ι have kept at home. I have written to

ἓ Oppius and to Balbus, asking them to consider how

Ι can move nearer to Rome. I think they will

advise me to do so. For they promise that Caesar
j will be anxious not only to preserve my dignity‚ but

even to increase it; and they bid me be of good

a cheer and entertain the highest of hopes. This they
} warrant and guarantee. Personally Ι should have
’ἓ felt surer about it, if Ι had stayed where I was. But
ζ that is harping on the past3 so pray look to the
. future and investigate the matter with them, and,
2 if you think it necessary and they approve, call in
ν Trebonius, Pansa and anyone else you like, that Ι
ἡ may win Caesar's approval by appearing to follow

 

his friend's advice, and let them write to Caesar,
telling him that, what I have done, Ι did at their
adfficyedear Tullia's illness and weakness frightens me
to death. Ι understand you are taking great care of
her, and Ι am very grateful. About Pompey's end
