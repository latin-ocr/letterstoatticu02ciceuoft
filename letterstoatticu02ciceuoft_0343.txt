LETTERS TO ATTICUS X. 11

me at any rate who love him, are more distressing
than even' the evils on which we have fallen, do not
’ proceed from any indulgence of mine3 for the are

deep rooted: but Ι would have rooted them up, llad I
been allowed. But the times are such that Ι must bear
everything. My own son I control easily. He is
quite tractable. My own policy has lacked vigour

» owing to my pity for him3 and the more he wants
» me to be unflinching, the more I sear I may prove

cruel to him.

well, Antony came yesterday evening3 soon per-
haps he will visit me, perhaps not even that, as he
has written what he wanted done3 but you shall
know forthwith what has happened. All I do now
is done secretly.

What shall Ι do about the boys? Shall Ι entrust

them to a small boat ? What courage do you suppose

ἶ I shall have on the voyage? For I remember sailing

in the summer in an open Rhodian boat with them

’ and how anxious Ι was3 and how do you suppose it
ἶ will be in the bad season in a tiny pinnace? Misery

 

everywhere!

Trebatius is with me, a real man and a loyal
citizen. Ye gods, what awful news he brings! So
even Balbus is thinking of attending the Senate!
But Ι will give Trebatius himself a letter for you to-
morrow. I agree with your letter that Vettienus is
friendly to me. But Ι made a rather bitter jest at
his expense, because he wrote curtly to me about
paying my debt. Appease him, if he took it in bad
part. I addressed him by his title “ commissioner of
the mint ” because he addressed me as “ proconsul.’'
But since he is a good man and has affection for me,
let me keep my affection for him. Farewell.
