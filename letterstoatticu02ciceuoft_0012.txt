INTRODUCTION

Another new law of Pompey’s insisted on the
personal attendance of candidates for office, from
which Caesar had previously obtained special exemp-
tion. On the remonstrance of Caesar's friends
Pompey had inserted a clause allowing such special ex-
emptions to stand: but this clause was never properly
passed. This again was designed to ensure Caesar’s
presence in Rome, with a view to his prosecution.

During the next two years the question of his
resignation was continually coming up in the House,
but no definite conclusion was reached, owing largely
to Curio's spirited attacks on all the Senatorial party’s
proposals. That party however was ready to catch
at any trifle to pick a quarrel with Caesar: and they
found an opportunity when in Sept. 50 B.C. Caesar
decided to send the 13th legion into Cisalpine Gaul
to replace the 15th, which he had had to surrender,
nominally for the war in Syria, though actually the
legion was kept in Italy. A report was circulated
that he was sending four legions to Placentia with
hostile intentioris. The report was disproved by
Curio: but, though the majority of the Senate sup·
ported the opposition, and refused to declare Caesar

On his return to Cisalpine Gaul in November, Caesar
ignored this illegal commission and privatel offered
to give up Transalpine Gaul on March 1, iiy allowed
to keep Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum with two legions
or even Illyricum with one. It was at this juncture
that Cicero returned to Italy, and he seems to have
spoken in favour of accepting this proposah though
shocked at Caesar’s “ impudence ’⁵ in making it. But
