CICERO To ATTICUS, GREETING.

Upset by this grave and most calamitous crisis, Cales,
though Ι have no opportunity of consulting you person- Feb. 18,
ally, still I wish to enjoy your advice. The whole B.C. 49

desert the company ofloyal and distinguished citizens,
I must fall into the power of one man, and, though he
gives me many tokens of regard (and you know well Ι

tive of his good will, is it proper for a man of courage
and loyalty to remain in Rome and lose his position
for the future where he has enjoyed the highest dis-
tinctions and commands, performed deeds of import-
ance, been invested with the highest seat in the
sacred college, and to suffer risks and perhaps some
shame, if ever Pompey restore the constitution? So
much for the arguments on one side.

Now look at those on the other. There is not an
atom of prudence or courage in Pompey's policy-—
and besides nothing that is not clean contrary to my
counsel and advice. I pass over the old grievance,
how Caesar was Pompey’s man: Pompey raised him
