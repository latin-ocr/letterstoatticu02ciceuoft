LETTERS TO ATrlcUS XI. 21

’ September. Tbere are said to be many things that
ὲ keep him in Asia, especially Pharnaces. The 12th
f legion, which Sulla visited first, is said to have driven
ζ him off with stones, and it is thought none os them

will stir. Caesar it is supposed will go straight from
Patrae to Sicily. But, if so, he must come here. 1
should have preferred him to go straight there, for
Ι should have got away from here somehow. Now
Ι am afraid Ι must wait for him, and in addition to
other afflictions my poor daughter must endure this
unhealthy climate.

You advise me to make my actions fit the times.
I would, if circumstances permitted, and it were
anyhow possible. But what with all my own mis-
takes and the wrongs inflicted on me by my family,
there is nothing worthy of myself that Ι can do or
even pretend to do. You compare Sulla’s reign:
that in principle was all that could be noble, but

κ it was rather too lacking in moderatiori. The pre-
, sent crisis however is such that Ι forget myself, and
’ should much prefer the public cause to win rather

than that with which my interests are bound up.
However, please write to me as often as possible,

ζ especially as no one else writes, and, if all the world
³ were writing‚ Ι should still look forward to your
f letters more than any. You say Caesar will be kinder

to Quintus for my sake ε but Ι told you before he had

η made every concession to young Quintus, without
ᾗ mentioning me. Farewell.
