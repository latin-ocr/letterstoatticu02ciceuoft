LETTERS TO A'ITICUS IX. 10-11

and to him, whenever it happens, acceptable. When
Ι say this, it is with the reservation, that, if Caesar
continues, as he has begun, acting with good saith,
moderatiori and prudence, I must thoroughly review
the matter and consider more closely what our
interests advise.” On the 9th of March you write
that my friend Peducaeus too approves my inaction:
ν and his authority has much weight with me. From
these lines of yours I console myself with the re-
flection that so far I have done nothing wrong: but
pray support your position. So far as I am concerned
there is no need: but I want others to be my ac-
complices. If I have not done wrong so far, I will
take care of the future. Do you maintain your exhor-
tations and assist me with your reflections. Here
nothing as yet has been heard about Caesar’s return.
For myself I have won thus much good by my letter,
Ϊ Ι have read all yours and found rest in the act.

CICERO TO ATTICUS‚ GREETING.

Do you know that our friend Lentulus is at Puteoli ? Formiae,

I heard this from a passer-by, who declared he recog- March 20,
nized him on the Appian road as he drew aside the 13.C. 49
curtains of his litter, and, though it seemed hardly

probable, I sent servants to Puteoli to track him and

hand him a letter. He was found with difficulty con-

cealing himself on his estate, and returned me a letter

in which he expressed amazing gratitude to Caesar.

But about his own plans he said he had sent me a

message by C. Caesius. I expect him to—day‚ the

20th of March.
Matius also came to me on the l9th of March.
