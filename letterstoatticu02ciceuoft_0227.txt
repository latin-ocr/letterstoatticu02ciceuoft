LETTERS TO ATTICUS IX. 7b

from his ῐὴουὲῑιζε· and Ι am, as in duty bound, v{ry
glad that he takes that view. As for yourself and
your honour and loyalty to your friends, I give you
my word, my dear Cicero, that I think as you do, that
your reputation and your duty will not admit of your
bearing arms against a man, from whom you acknow-

ledge that you have received such favours. Ι have
not the slightest doubt that Caesar with his extraor-
dinary kindness will agree, and that you will satisfy
him abundantly, by taking no part against him
in the war and not siding with his opponents. And
this he will count sufficient not only in the case of so

not to enter a camp which would be opposed to Len·

tulus and Pompey‚ to whom I am under great obliga-

tions: and he has said he is quite satisfied, if I should
perform peaceful civic functions for him, which Ι am
at liberty to perform for them too, if Ι wish. So Ι
am acting now as Lentulus' deputy at Rome and
carrying out his business, fulfilling my duty and
maintaining my honour and loyalty to them. But
really, though Ι had given up hope of peace, 1 am
no longer‘ 1n despair of it, since Caesar is in the mood
in which we would wish him to be.

Under the circumstances I see no obj ection, if you
think fit, to your writing and asking for his protection,
