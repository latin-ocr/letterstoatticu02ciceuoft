LETTERS TO ATTICUS VIII. 14

than we want. You may wonder why Ι forestall dis-
agreeable tidings which will be known in three days’
time. Ι have no reason, except, as I said before, that
I love to talk to you ; and at the same time I want you
to know that what I had counted my fixed resolve is
shaken. The precedents you quote with approval
don't quite fit my case. Tbey are those of men who
have never distinguished themselves by great political
action, and are not looked up to for any act of merit.
Nor, let me tell you, have I any praise for those who
have crossed the sea to make preparations for war—
unbearable as things here were. For I foresee how
great and calamitous that war will be. I am influ-
enced only by one man, whom I think I ought to ac-
company in ssight, and help in the restoration of the
constitution. I may seem variable; but I talk with
you as I talk with myself, and there is no one who, in
such a crisis, does not view matters in many lights.
Moreover, Ι want to get your opinion, to encourage
me, if you have not changed it, or otherwise to win
my assent. It is particularly necessary for me to
know in my dilemma what course Domitius and my
friend Lentulus will take.

As for Domitius I hear many reports: at one time
that he is at Tibur out of sortS‚ at another that he
has consorted with the Lepidi in their march to Rome.

ff That I see is untrue. For Lepidus says that he is

following a hidden path, but whether to hide or reach
the sea even he does not know. Lepidus has no news
about his son either. He adds a provoking detail,
that Domitius has failed to get back a large sum of
money which he had at Corfinium. Of Lentulus I
have no news. Please make inquiries on these points
and inform me.
