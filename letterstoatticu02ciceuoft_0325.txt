LETTERS TO ATTICUS X. 8-8a

many kindnesses none has given me greater pleasure
than your very gracious and constant care of Tullia.
She herself has been charmed and Ι not less. She

; has shown admirable quahties, has borne the national
l calamity and private worries with great fortitude

 

and displayed it over my departure. She loves me

μ and sympathizes with me and yet wishes me to act ¹
ι rightly and keep my good repute. But enough of
¹ this, lest I begin to pity myself.

If you get more certain tidings about Spain or any
other matter, pray write and tell me while I am

’ here, and perhaps at the time of going I may send

you news, the more so because Tullia fancies that
you are not leaving Italy at the present moment. I
must explain to Antony as Ι did to Curio that Ι
want to stay in Malta and refuse to take part in this
civil war. Ι only hope that I may find him as easy
and good to me as Ι found Curio. He will come it
is said to Misenum on the second, that is to-day;
but he has sent in advance a nasty letter of which Ι
subjoin a copy:

u ANTONIUS TRIBUNE PROPRAETOR GREETING TO CICERO
IMPERATOR.

“ Had I not a great affection for you‚and much more

’ than you think, I should not have been alarmed at a

report which has been spread about you, especially as

q I thought it to be false. But, just because Ι like you

so very much, Ι cannot hide from myself that the
report, although it may be false, causes me great con-
cern. That you are about to go overseas I cannot
believe, when you have such dear regard for Dolabella
