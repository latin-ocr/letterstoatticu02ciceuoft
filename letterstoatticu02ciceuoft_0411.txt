LETTERS To ATTICUS XI. 14

XIV

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

Ι am not offended with you for telling me the truth Brundisium,
in your letter and not even attempting, as you were circa Apr.
wont, to console me under my burden of public and 25, 13.c. 47
personal woes, which you confess is impossible now.

For affairs are no longer in the position they were,
when, if nothing else, I thought I had companions and
partners in my policy. For all those in Achaia and in
Asia, who petitioned for pardon and did not obtain
it, and even some of those who did, are said to be on
the point of sailing for Africa. So I have no one to
share my fault except Laelius, and even he is in a
better position than I am in one respect, as he has
been taken back now.1 But about me Ι have no
doubt that Caesar has written to Balbus and Oppius ι
if the news had been good, I should have heard from
them and they would have spoken to you too. I
should like you to speak to them about it and to let
me know what they say, not that any safeguard
given by him can have any certainty, but still some-
thing can be foreseen and provided for. Though I
ξ am ashamed to look anyone in the face, especially
’ with such a son-in-law, still in this disastrous crisis I
see nothing else to wish for. Quintus is still keep-
ing on, as both Pansa and Hirtius have written to tell
[ me; and he is said too to be making for Africa with
the rest. I will write to Minucius at Tarentum, and

send your letter: I will let you know whether any-

¹ thing comes of it. Ι should have been surprised that
