CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

As you suppose, I am in great anxiety of mind: Formiae,
but it is not so great as you may imagine. Ι am rid Feb. 27,
of care, as soon as resolve is fixed or thought proves B.c. 49
futile. Stil] Ι may lament my lot as I do all day long.

But Ι sear, since lamentation is idle, Ι disgrace my
philosophy and my works. So I spend my time con-
sidering the character of the ideal statesman, who
is sketched clearly enough, you seem to think, in
my books on the Republie. You remember then the
standard by which our ideal governor was to weigh

ξ his acts. Here are Scipio’s words, in the 5th book, I
think it is: ‘⁸ As a safe voyage is the aim of the pilot,
⁵ health of the physician‚ victory of the general, so
’ἒ the ideal statesman will aim at happiness for the
ἱ citizens of the state to give them material security,
’ copious wealth, wide-reaching distinction and un-
} tarnished honour. This, the greatest and finest of
; human achievements‚ I want him to perform.'' Pom-

pey never had this notion and least of all in the

³ present cause. Absolute power is what he and Caesar

have sought3 their aim has not been to secure the
happiness and honour of the community. Pompey

defend, nor Italy on forced compulsion 3 but it was his

2 idea from the first to plunge the world into war, to

stir up barbarous princes, to bring savage tribes into
