CICERO TO ATTICUS,GREET1NG.

I have positively no news: all mine is known to

Formiae,

you; and there is none that I can look for from y.ou Dec 17

Only let me preserve my old ceremony of letting no
visitor go to you without a letter. My fears as to the
political situation are great. And so far I have
found hardly a man who would not yield to Caesar's
’ demand sooner than fight. That demand, it is true,
is shameless‚ but stronger than we thought. But

J why should we choose this occasion to begin resisting?

‘⁴ No greater evil threatens now ’'

than when we prolonged his office for another five
years ; or when we agreed to let him stand as a candi-
date in his absence. But perhaps we were then giving
him these weapons to turn against us now. You will
say z ‘⁴ What then will your view be? ” My view will
not be what Ι shall say3 for my view will be that
every step should be taken to avoid a conflict3 but I
shall say the same as Pompey, nor shall I be actuated
by subserviency. But again it is a very great calamity
to the state, and in a way improper to me beyond
others to differ from Pompey in matters of such
importance.
