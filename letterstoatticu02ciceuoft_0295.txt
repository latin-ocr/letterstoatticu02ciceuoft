LETTERS TO ATTICUS X. 2-3

The ‘⁴ bird that twitters of flight '' 1 is here and Ι am
afire with eagerness, though Ι have no idea of
destination or route. But these will be considered
by me and by those who know. You however must
assist me with your advice, so far as possible, as you
have before. ΤΙιε tangle cannot be unravelled.
Everything must be entrusted to fortune. We are
‚ simply struggling without hope. If anything better
happens, I shall be surprised. Ι would rather
Dionysius did not come to me: Tullia has written
to me about him. The time is unsuitable, and I
should prefer that discomforts as great as mine
should not be seen by a man who is not my friend.
But Ι (10 not want you to be his enemy on my account.

CICERO To ATTICUS, GREETING.

Though Ι have nothing at all to write about, yet Arcanum,
these points remain, which I want to know. Has April 7,
Caesar started? In what condition has he left B.C. 49
Rome? In Italy itself whom has he placed in charge
, of each region or department? Who were sent to
Pompey and the consuls as peace commissioners
ζ according to the decree of the Senate? To make

these inquiries Ι have taken the trouble to send
this letter. So you will do well and please me, if
you inform me on these points and of anything else
· which Ι ought to know. Ι stay in Arcanum till I
get information.
