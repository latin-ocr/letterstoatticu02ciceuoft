 

LETTERS ΤΟ. ATTICUS IX. 2—2a

from you, still I suppose Ι ought to answer the shorter
note, which you sent on the 4th on the eve of your
attack. You say you are glad that Ι have stayed in
Italy, and you write that you abide by your former
view. But an earlier letter led me to think you had
no doubt I ought to go, if Pompey embarked with a
good following and the consuls crossed too. Have
you forgotten this, or have I failed to understand
you, or have you changed your mind? But I shall
either learn your opinion from the letter I now await:
or I shall extract another letter from you. From
Brundisium so far there is no news.

CICERO To ATTICUS, GREETING.

What a difficult and calamitous business! Nothing Formiae,
passed over in the advice you give, nothing revealed March 8,
as to your real opinion! You are glad that I am not Rc, 49
with Pompey, and yet you lay down how wrong it
would be for me to be present when he is criticized ε it
were shameful to approve his conduct. Agreed.

Should I then speak against him? “ Heaven forbid,”
you say. So, what can happen, if one way lies crime,
and the other punishment? You advise me to get

, from Caesar leave of absence and permission to re-
tire. Must I then beg and pray? That would be

' humiliating: and suppose I fail? You say the matter
of my triumph will not be prejudiced. But what if

Ι am hampered by that very thing? Accept it?
What dishonour! Refuse it? Caesar will think that

I am repudiating him entirely, more even than when

I declined a place among his twenty land commis-
sioners.l And it is his way, when he excuses himself
