LETTERS TO ATTICUS IX. 16—17

those, whom I let go, have departed to wage war on
me again, for there is nothing I like better than that Ι
should be true to myself and they to themselves. Ι
could wish you to meet me at Rome that I may avail
myself of your advice and resources, as usual, in every-
thing. You must know that nothing pleases me
more than the presence of your relative Dolabella.
This favour also I shall owe to him3 for he will not
be able to do otherwise than arrange it, such is his
kindness, his feeling and goodwill towards me.'’

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

I arn awaiting Trebatius on March the 27th, the Formiae,
date os this letter. From his tidings and Matius’ March 27,
letter I shall consider how to talk to Caesar. What B.C. 49
a wretched age this is! I have no doubt Caesar will
urge me to come to Rome. For he gave orders that
notices should be posted even at Formiae that he
wanted a full house on the lst. Must I refuse? But
why do I anticipate? I will write you all about it at
once. From Caesar's conversation Ι shall decide
whether I ought to go to Arpinum or elsewhere. I
wish to celebrate my son's coming of age. Arpinum,

I think, will be the place. Please consider what Ι
should do next, for my troubles have made me stupid.

“ From Curius I want to hear whether you have had

news about Tiro. For to me Tiro has written in such
a way that Ι am anxious to know how he is. Those
two who come from his part say that his condition is
critical. In the midst of many great troubles this

, also distresses me3 for in our present straits his

energy and loyalty would be very serviceable. 6
