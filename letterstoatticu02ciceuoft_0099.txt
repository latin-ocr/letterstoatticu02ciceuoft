LETTERS TO ATTICUS VII. 19—20

XIX

CICERO ΤΟ ATTICUS.

Ι have no news for you, and have not even sent Formiae,
you my lucubiat1on of last night: for that was a letter Feb. 3,
full of good cheer, because Ι had heard of the tem- B. e. 49
per shown at the public meeting, and thought that
Caesar would abide by terms which were in fact his
own. But now on this, the morning of the 3rd of
February, I have got a letter from you, one from
Philotimus, one from Furnius, and one from Curio to
Furnius ridiculing the mission of L. Caesar. We
appear to be crushed utterly, nor do I know what
plan to take. I am not indeed in trouble about my-
self, it is the boys that put me in 3 dilemma. Still
I am setting out for Capua, as I write this, that I may
η more easilyt> get to know Pompey' 3 affairs.

CICERO ΤΟ ATTICUS.

The occasion makes me brief. 1 have abandoned Formiae,
hope of peace: but our party takes no steps for war. Feb. 5,
Pray don't suppose that there is anything of less B.C. 49
concern to our present consuls than the war. I came
to Cap ua on the 4th according to instructions, in
heavyp rain, with the hope of hearing something from
them and getting to know of our equipment. ὅΤίιεὲγ
had not yet arrived, but were expected, empty-

’ handed‚ unprepared. Pompey was reported to be at
Luceria and close to some cohorts 1 of the shaky

³ Or“ and some cohorte are approaching.”
