LETTERS TO ATTICUS X. 10-—11

. get medical advice in its initial stage. Your letter
about the Massilians1 pleased me. Let me know
'⁴ whatever you hear. I should have liked to have
Ocella, if it could be done openly, and Ι had got
Curio to allow it. Here I am awaiting Servius
Sulpicius, for it is at the request of his wife and son,
and I think it is necessary. Antony carries about
Cytheris 2 with him in an open litter as his second
⁷ wife, and besides he had seven other litters of friends
= male or female. See what a disgraceful death we
die, and doubt, if you can, that, whether Caesar
returns victor or vanquished‚ he will perpetrate a
’ massacre. Even in an open boat, if I cannot get
a vessel, I will tear myself away from these parricides
and their doings. But I will write more when I have
met him.
Ι My nephew I cannot but love, though Ι see clearly
, that he has no affection for me. I never saw anyone
³ so unprincipled, so averse to his own relations, with
’ such mysterious plans. What a weight of anxiety!
But it will be my business, as it is now, to discipline
him: he has wonderful ability, but his character
1 requires training.
