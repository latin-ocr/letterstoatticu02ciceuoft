LETTERS TO ATTICUS X. 0-9a

his way with large forces into Germany through
ἦ Illyricum, for that was the news sans doute. So Ι
think I must make for Malta, until there is news from
= Spain. This from Caesar’s letter I almost think I
may do without annoying him, for he says there is
no more honourable or safe course open to me than
to keep quite clear of the fight. You will say
‘⁴ Where then is your courage which you showed in
, recent letters? ” It is there and the same3 but would
that Ι had only to decide for myself. The tears of
my family at times weaken me, when they beg me to
wait for news about Spain. The miserable tone of
M. Caelius’ letter making this same request that I
should wait, not to risk so rashly my fortunes‚ my
« only son and all my family, moved our boys to weep-
ing3 although my own son is made of stronger stuff,
and for that very reason he affects me more deeply‚
, thinking only of my reputation.

κ So Ι shall go to Malta, thence where it seems good.
Still even now send me a line, especially if there is
5 any news from Afranius. If I have an interview

ἶ ever, as you advise‚ I will take care how I trust him,
for the policy of concealment is hard and dangerous
l too. Servius Sulpicius I await till the 7th. Both
, his wife Postumia and his son urge me to this. 1 re-
ι joice that your ague is better. Ι send you also a
ἰ copy of Caelius' letter.

CAELIUS TO CICERO, GREETING.

that your thoughts are set on some unhappy act Apr. 16,
