LETTERS TO ATTICUS VIII. 16

CICERO To ATTICUS.

Ι have made provision for everything except a Formiae,
secret and safe passage to the Adriatic. The other March 4,
route I cannot face at this time of the year. How B.C. 49
can I get to that place on which my mind is set, and
whither fate calls? My departure must be in haste,
for fear some obstacle and hindrance should arise.

Itis not, as one might think, Pompey who induces me
to go. Ι have long known him to be the poorest of
statesmen, and I now see he is the poorest of generals.
Ι am not induced by him, but by the common talk of
which Philotimus informs me. He says that the
loyalists are tearing me to tatters. Loyalists‚ good
God! And see how they are running to meet Caesar,
and selling themselves to him. The country towns
are treating him as a god, and there is no pretence
about it, as there was in the prayers for Pompey’s
recovery from illness. Any mischief this Pisistratus
may leave undone will give as much satisfaction as if
he had prevented another from doing it. People
hope to placate Caesar3 they think that Pompey is

η angered. What ovations from the towns and what

honour is paid him! In fright I dare say, but they are

ς’ more afraid of Pompey. They are delighted with the
ι cunning kindness of Caesar, and afraid of the anger
, of his rival. Th0se who are on the jury list of 360
. judges, the especial partisans of Pompey, some of

 

whom Ι see daily‚ shudder at vague Lucerias ¹ which
they conjure up. So I ask what sort of loyalists are

¹ Cf. vm, 11, where Pompey at Luceria is said to hav}
talked of a proscription.
