LETTERS TO ATTICUS VII. 8—9

an army ; and he fancies that when Caesar hears of the
energetic preparations against him, he will give up
the idea of the consulship this year, and prefer to
keep his army and his province. Still, if Caesar
should play the fool, Pompey has an utter contempt
for him, and firm confidence in his own and the
state’s resources. Well, although the ‘⁴ uncertainty Iliad xviii, 309
of war ’⁹ came constantly into my mind, I was relieved
of anxiety as I listened to a soldier, a strategist, and a
man of the greatest influence discoursing in a states-
manlike way on the risks of a hollow peace. We had
before us a speech of Antony made on the 21st of
' December, which attacked Pompey from boyhood,
complained about the condemnation of certain people
and threatened war. Pompey's comment was “ What
do you suppose Caesar will do, if 116 becomes master
J of the state, when a wretched, insi nificant subordi-
” nate dares to talk in this strain? ' In a word, he
appeared not only not to seek peace, but even to
fear it. But Ι fancy the idea of leaving the city
v shakes his resolution. What annoys me most is that
1 have to pay up to Caesar, and devote to the pur-
* pose what I should have used for my triumph. It is
ᾗ bad form to· owe money to a political opponent.
ᾗ But this and many other topics can wait till we
meet.
