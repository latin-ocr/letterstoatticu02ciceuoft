LETTERS TO ATTICUS IX. 6

take this grief away from me, or at any rate lessen
it by your sympathy or advice or by any other
possible means. Yet what can you or any man do?
God Himself could hardly help now.

But my own aim now is to achieve what you
advise and hope, that Caesar excuse my absence,
when any measure is brought forward against Pompey
in the house. But I fear Ι may fail. Furnius has
come from Caesar. To show you the sort of men I
am following, he tells me that the son of Q. Titinius
is with Caesar, but Caesar expresses greater thanks
to me than I could wish. His request put in a few
words, but ex cathedra, you may see from his letter.
How grieved I am at your ill-health! We should
have been together3 assuredly advice would not have
been wanting: ‘⁶ Two heads are better than one.'' mad x, 224

But let us not fight battles over again, let us attend
to the future. Till now two things have led me
astray, at first the hope of a settlement‚ and, if that
were secured, I was ready for private life and an old
age quit of public cares; and then I discovered that
Pompey was beginning a bloody and destructive war.
On my honour I thought that it was the part of a
better man and a better citizen to suffer any punish-
ment rather than‚ I will not say to take a leading
part, but even to take any part in such atrocities.
It seems as though it would have been preferable to
die than to be one of such men. So, my dear
Atticus, think on these problems, or rather think

them out. I shall bear any result more bravely than
this affliction.
