LETTERS To ATTlcUs lx. 7a-7b

was going to do, what in our opinion he ought to do,
as soon as he reaches Rome, that is to say try to
effect a reconciliation with Pompey, we should feel
it our duty to exhort you to take part in the nego-
tiations, as the whole thing could most easily and
with the greatest dignity be carried through by you,
who have ties with both parties. If on the contrary
we thought Caesar was not going to follow that
course, and knew that he even wished to wage war
with Pompey, we should never advise you to bear
arms against a man who has done you such good
service, just as we have always begged you not to
fight against Caesar. But, since Caesar's intentioris
are still mere guesswork, we can only say that it
does not seem consonant with your dignity or your
well-known sense of honour to bear arms against
either of them, as you are intimate with both: and
we have no doubt that Caesar will be generous
enough to approve of this course. If you wish it,
however, we will write to Caesar to ascertain his
intentions in this matter. If he sends us an answer,
we will let you know our opinion at once, and con·
vince you that we are giving the advice which seems
to us to be best for your dignity, not for Caesar's
policy, and, such is Caesar's consideration for his
friends, that we feel sure he will approve of such a
course.
