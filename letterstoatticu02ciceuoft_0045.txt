LETTERS TO ATTICUS VII. 3

Caelius has taken the Porta Flumentana,1 Ι don't see
why I should not make Puteoli mine.

Coming to the form Piraeea, Ι am more to be
blamed for writing it thus and not Piraeum in Latin,
as all our people do, than I am for adding the pre·-
position ‘⁶ in.'' Ι used “ in ” as before a word signify-
ing a place and not a town. After all Dionysius
and Nicias of Cos, who is with me, do not consider
that the Piraeus is a town. I will look into the
question. If Ι have made a mistake‚ it is in speak-
ing of it not as a town but as a place, and I have
authority. Ι do not depend on a quotation from
Caeciliust “ Mane ut ex portu in Piraeum,” 2 as he
is a poor authority in Latinity3 but I will quote
Terence, whose fine style caused his plays to be
ascribed to C. Laelius: “Heri aliquot adulescentuli
’ coiimus in Piraeum,'’ and again: “ Mercator hoc adde-
bat, captam e Sunio.'' 3 If we want to call parishes
towns, Sunium is as much a town as the Piraeus.
But, since you are a purist, you will save me a lot of
J trouble, if you can solve the problem for me.

Caesar sends me a friendly letter. Balbus does
the same on his account. Certainly Ι shall not
. swerve a finger's breadth from the strictest honour;
, but you know how much I still owe him. Don't you
= think there is fear that this may be cast in my
· teeth, if I am slack3 and rcpayment demanded from
me, if I am energetic? What solution is there?

¹ Caelius had bought Lucceius’ property near the Porta
Flumentana at the entrance of the Campus Martius.

¹ In the morning as I disembarked in the Piraeus.

³ Terence, Eun. 539 (yesterday while some of us youths
met in the Piraeus), and 115 (The merchant added one

thing more, a female slave from Sunium). In the first the
γ MSS. of Terence read Piraeo.
