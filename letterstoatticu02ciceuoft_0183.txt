me all along. To remain in Italy is certainly safer:
to cross the sea the path of honour. Sometimes I
prefer that many should accuse me of rashness, rather
than the select few of dishonourable action. For
your query about Lepidus and Tullus, they have

had said he would be angry with every one who did not leave
Rome, even with Jupiter.
