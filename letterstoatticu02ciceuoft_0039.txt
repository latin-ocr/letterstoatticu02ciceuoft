LETTERS TO ATTICUS VII. 3

is a matter for deliberation, though Ι agree with you
in the main. You do well not to doubt my attitude
towards politics: and you judge rightly that Caesar
has not been liberal to me considering my services,
and considering his lavishness towards others. You
explain his reasons rightly: Ι am in the same boat
with Fabius and Caninius,l as your letter shows. But
if things were otherwise and he had been profuse in
his generosity towards me, nevertheless the goddess
you mention, the guardian of the city, would have
compelled me to remember her fine inscription, and
would not allow me to imitate Volcacius or Servius,²
with whom you are content, but would wish me to

’ express and maintain a poliey worthy of my name.

And Ι should have done it, if I could, in a different
way from the way I must adopt now.

It is for their own power men are fighting now to
the danger of the country. For if the constitution
is being defended, why was it not defended when
Caesar himself was consul? Why was Ι, on whose
case the safety of the constitution depended, not
defended in the following year? Why was Caesar's
command prolonged, or why was it prolonged in such

, a fashion ? Why was there such a struggle to get the
ff ten tribunes to bring in a bill allowing him to stand
¹ in his absence? All this has made him so strong

that now hope of resistance depends on one citizen.
1 wish that citizen had not given him so much power
rather than that he now resisted him in the hour of

¹ Leyati of Caesar: but nothing is known of any slight on
themssefooe his exile Cicero dedicated a statue of Minerva in
the Capitol with the inscription Custos U rbis. Possibly, how-
ever, there was a longer inscription. Volcacius and Servius
maintained neutrality in the civil war.
