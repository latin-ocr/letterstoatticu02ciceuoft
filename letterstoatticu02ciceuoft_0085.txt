LETTERS TO ATTICUS VII. 14—15

is uneasy as to our forces. I am wanted at Capua to
assist the levy. The settlers in Campania are hang-
ing back. As for Caesar's professional fighting men
at Capua, about whom Ι misinformed you on the
authority of A. Torquatus, Pompey has very cleverly
distributed them two a-piece to heads of families.
There were 5,000 heavy armed gladiator-S in the
school. They were said to meditate a sortie. Pom-

As for my women-folk, among whom is your sister,
I entreat you to consider the propriety of their stay
at Rome, when the other ladies of their rank have
departed. 1 wrote to them and to you on this point
previously. Please urge them to leave the city,
especially as I have those estates on the sea-coast,
which is under my care, so that they can live there
without much inconvenience, considering the state
of affairs. For, if Ι give offence by the conduct

χ of my son-in—law (though Ι am not his keeper),

the fact that my women-folk stay in Rome after
others have left makes matters worse. I should like
to know what you and Sextus think about leaving

, town, and to have your opinion of matters in general.

As for me, Ι cease not to advocate peace. It may be
on unjust terms, but even so it is more expedient
than the justest of civil wars. However, I can but
leave it to fate.
