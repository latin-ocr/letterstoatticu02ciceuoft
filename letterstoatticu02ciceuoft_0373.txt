LETTERS TO ATTICUS XI. 2-3

house, I am the most wretched man alive. Ι pray
and beseech you pardon me. I can write no more.
You see, Ι am sure, with what a weight of misery Ι
’ am oppressed. If 1 shared it with others, who seem
to be in the same predicament, Ι should feel less
blameworthy and bear it better. Now I have no
consolation unless you can arrange, if it is now pos-
sible, that I may not be visited with any special
disaster and harm.

1 have been rather slow in sending back your
letter-carrier, because there was no opportunity of
sending him. From your agents Ι have received
some „2600 ¹ and the necessary clothing. Please send
letters to any people you think right in my name.
You know my intimate friends. If they notice the
absence of my seal or handwriffing, please say Ι have
avoided using them owing to the sentries.

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

What is happening here you may gather from the Camp qs
bearer of your letter. I have kept him longer than Pompey,
I should, because every day I am expecting something June 13,
fresh to happen, and there was no reason for sending ac. 48
him even now, except the subject on which you ask
for an answer, namely what Ι wish as to the first of
July. Both courses are dangerous, both the risk of
such a sum of money at such a dangerous time, and
the breaking with Dolabella, which you mention,
while the political issue is still uncertain. Accord-
ingly Ι will leave this matter in particular like others

² 70,000 sesterces.
