LETTERS To ATTICUS lx, 19

So dark and direful is the coup d'oeil of this vast
calamity. Levies are being made3 troops are being
drafted into winter quarters. These measures are
hardships in themselves even when taken by loyalists‚
when the war is just, when there is some considera-

taken quite tyrannically by desperadoes in wicked

Βξ civil war. But you must remember that every

scoundrel in Italy is of the party. Ι saw them all

to be human. I knew every one of them, but I had
never seen the whole collection together.

Let us go then whither we please‚ and leave our
all behind. Let us set out to Pompey, who will be
more gratified at our arrival than if we had been
with him all along. For then we had great hopes3
but now I at least have none : nor has anyone except
myself departed from Italy, unless he imagines Caesar

take this step for -the sake of the Republic, which to
my mind is utterly destroyed, but for sear I may be
charged with ingratitude to one who relieved me
from the inconveniences which he himself had in-
flicted: and, at the same time, because I cannot
endure the sight of the horrors that are happening
and are bound to happen. Moreover I fancy that
now decrees of the Senate have been passed, and my

’ only hope is that they will agree with Volcacius’

proposal. But what does it matter? There is only
one proposal for everybody. But the most implacable
enemy will be Servius, who has sent his son with

¹ Pontius Titinianus to destroy or at least to capture

Gnaeus Pompey. Tliough Titinianus has the excuse
of fear, what excuse has Servius? But let us cease
