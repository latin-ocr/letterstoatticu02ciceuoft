LETTERS TO ATTICUS IX. 7

have no hope of ease for myself and Ι do not refuse
to contemplate as possible any bitterness. The one
thing I dread is doing, or, perhaps Ι should say,
having done, anything disgraceful.

So please consider that your letter -was good for
me, and not only the longer, most explicit and per-
fect epistle‚ but also the shorter, in which the most
delightful thing was to find that my policy and action
is approved by Sextus. You have done me a great
kindness. . . ‚1 Of his affection and sense of honour
I am sure. But that longer letter of yours has
relieved not only me but all my friends from our
sorry state: so Ι will follow your advice and remain
in the villa at Formiae, that my meeting with Caesar
outside the city may not excite comment, or, if Ι do
not meet him either here or there, I may not lead
him to think I have shunned him. As for your
advice to ask him to allow me to pay Pompey the
same homage as Ι did to him, you will understand I
have been doing that long since, when you see the
copies Ι forward of letters of Balbus and Oppius. Ι
send also a letter addressed by Caesar to them, which
is sane enough considering these mad times. But, if
Caesar should refuse my request, I see that you think
I should undertake to be a peace-maker. In that role
I do not fear danger—for, with so many dangers
overhanging, why should I not compound by taking
the most respectable—but Ι fear lest I may embarrass
Pompey, and he fix on me ‘⁴ the Gorgon gaze of his
dread eye.'' It is wonderful to see how Pompey Odyssey xi, 663
desires to imitate Sulla’s reign. Ι know what Ι am
saying. He has made no secret of it. Then why

opinion.
