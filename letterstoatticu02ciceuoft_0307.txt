LETTERS TO ATI'ICUS X. 4

proceed from him.'’ “ But why six? '’ ‘⁶ Because Ι

didn’t want twelve‚ though Ι could have had them.’'
I said: ‘¹ I wish Ι had asked for what I hear Philippus
i has got from him: but I was afraid to ask, as he got
, nothing from me.'' He replied: “He would willingly
· have given you permission. But take it that you

did get it. I will write to him just as you wish, and

¹ say we have spoken about the matter. What does

it matter to him where you are, as you do not attend

” the House? If you were not in Italy at this very
ἑ moment, it would not damage his cause in the least.''

 

I responded that Ι was looking for a retired and
solitary retreat, especially because I still had my
lictors in attendance. He agreed with me. “ How
about this then,” said Ι. “My way through to
Greece lies through your province, as the Adriatic is
guarded.’' ‘⁸ There is nothing I should like better‚”

2 he said, and added many very handsome remarks.
, So something has come of it: Ι could sail not only in
safety, but openly.

The rest he put off for the next day ι Ι will write and

= tell you if there is anything worth mentioning. But

there are some things I omitted to ask: whether
Caesar was going to wait for an interregnum, or
what he meant by saying that he had been offered

· the consulship but had refused it for the next year.

And there are other points I must ask about. Finally

⁸ he swore——though to be sure he makes no bones

about swearing—that Caesar was very friendly to

ἶ me. I expressed my doubt. He said he had heard
from Dolabella. I asked what he said, and he
Α declared he said Caesar had thanked him warmly for

 

wanting me to go to Rome, and not only approved
but showed pleasure. Of course Ι felt relieved.
