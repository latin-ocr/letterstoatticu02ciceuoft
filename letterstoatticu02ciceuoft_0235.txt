LETTERS TO ATTICUS IX. 9

to believe the reports about the number of Pompey’s
soldiers. Clodia’s letter made them just double. It
was untrue also about the destruction of the vessels.
You praise the consuls3 so do I praise their courage,
but I blame their policy. Their departure has de-
stroyed the negotiations for peace, the very thing
which I was contemplating. So after that Ι returned

is imminent, which will be ushered in by famine.
And here Ι am lamenting that I have no hand in the
war, a war which will be so criminal, that though it
is wicked not to support one’s parents, yet our chiefs
will not hesitate to destroy by starvation their country,
that most reverend and holiest of parents! And my
fears are not based on mere surmise. I have heard
their talk. All this fleet from Alexandria, Colchis,
Tyre, Sidon, Aradus, Cyprus, Pamphylia, Lycia,
Rhodes, Chius, Byzantium, Lesbos, Smyrna, Miletus,
Cos, is being got ready to cut off the supplies of Italy
and to blockade the grain-producing provinces. And
how angry Pompey will be when he comes, particu-
larly with those who particularly desire his safety, as
if he were abandoned by those whom he has aban-

greatly swayed by my good feeling towards Pompey.
Without that it were better to perish in my country,
than to destroy my country by saving it. As to the

to a passage in Tuae. 111, 27, where Cicero says Dionysius
took to schoolmastering because he wished to -tyrannize
over somebody, is uncertain. If the latter, it would mean
that, the optimates would ill-use Cicero again as soon as
they got the power.
