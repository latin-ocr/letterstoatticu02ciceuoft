LETTERS TO ATTICUS VIII. 1-2

So you need not wonder, if I am reluctant to em-
bark on a cause, which has no policy for peace or
victory, but always a policy of disastrous and disgrace-
ful flight. Ι must go to face whatever fortune bring,
with so·called loyalists rather than seem to disagree
with real loyalists. Yet I see Rome will soon be
crammed with loyalists, Ι mean with men of wealth and
fortune, crammed full, when the towns have been
abandoned. I would be among them, were it not for
these tiresome lictorS. I should not be ashamed of
the company of Μ’. Lepidus, L. Volcacius, Ser. Sulpi-
cius, not one of whom is a bigger fool than L. Domi-
tius, nor a bigger trimmer than Ap. Claudius. Only
Pompey weighs with me, for his past kindnesses, not
for his public influence. For what influence has he
in this case? When we were all afraid of Caesar, he
cherished him. After he has begun to fear Caesar,
he thinks all should be Caesar’s enemies. Still I shall
go to Luceria. Perhaps he will not be pleased to
meet me, for I shall not be able to disguise my dis-
gust at what he has done so far. If I could sleep, Ι
would not bother you with such long letters. If you
suffer from the same complaint, I shall be glad if you
will pay me back in the same coin.
