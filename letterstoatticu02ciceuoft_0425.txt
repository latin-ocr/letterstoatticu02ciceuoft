LETTERS TO ATTICUS XI. 17-18

though it would not have been of any importance, if
Ὗ it had been true. I hear L. Terentius has lest Africa
; and come to Paestum. What news he brings, or how
ᾗ he got out, or what is happening in Africa, I should
„ like to know. For he is said to have been passed out
ζ through the agency of Nasidius. What it all means,
Ι wish you would write and tell me, if you find out.

CICERO To ATTICUS, GREETING.

There is no rumour of his leaving Alexandria as Brundisium,
yet: on the contrary, he is thought to be in great June 19,
⁴ difficulties. So Ι am'not sending my son, as Ι had B.C. 47
arranged, and I beseech you to get me away from
⁵ here: for any punishment is lighter to bear than
⁴ staying here. On this point I have written to
Antony, to Balbus and to Oppius. For whether
³ there is going to be a war in Italy, or whether he
will employ his fleet—-and it may be either, but one
, it must be—this is a most inappropriate place for me.
I understood of course from what Oppius said accord-
lnfiem ’ἓιῗὲῗῖἱῖὲ ῗιῗὲἶέἓέἑζέὴθῖ ἒὲἰῖἶξρῐὲἓέεἷζῗ
’ thing {ow that is not unpleasant: but my present
ι condition is as desperate as anything ean be. So
please speak with Antony and the Caesarians‚ and
= see the matter through for me as best you can: and
’ let me have an¹ answer on all points as soon as
possible. Farewell.
June 14.
