LETTERS TO ATTICUS VIII. 15a

the same view; but it is rather a dream of mine
than a hope, that he can be persuaded to come to
terms at this time. When he becomes settled and
recovers from fright, Ι shall have better hopes that
your influence may avail with him.

In desiring my friend the consul Lentulus to remain
in Rome, you have gratified Caesar, and myself too, I
may assure you, in the highest degree. I value Len-
tulus as much as Caesar. If he had allowed me to
renew my old intercourse, and had not again and
again avoided conversation with me, I should be less
unhappy than I am. For do not think that this crisis
causes anyone more torment than it causes me, when
I see him, to whom Ι am more devoted than to myself,
acting in office in a way quite unfitted for a consul.
If he only takes your advice and believes our pro-
fessions about Caesar, and serves the remainder of
his office in Rome, then I shall begin to hope that by
the advice of the Senate, on your suggestion and at
his formal motion, there may be effected a recon-
ciliation between Pompey and Caesar. In that event
Ι shall think my life’s mission accomplished.

I know that you will approve entirely of Caesar’s
action about Corfinium. Under the circumstances
there could have been nothing better than a settle-
ment without bloodshed. Ι am delighted that you

² are pleased with the arrival of my and your Balbus.

 

Whatever Balbus has told you about Caesar, and what·
ever Caesar has said to you in his letters, I am confi-
dent Caesar will convince you by his acts, be his for-
tune what it will, that his professions were quite
Sincere.
