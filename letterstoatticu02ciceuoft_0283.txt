LETTERS TO A'ITICUS IX. 18—19

bold. Ι see no end to our evil days. Now assuredly
you must produce your advice. This was the limit
we contemplated.

Caesar’s finale, which Ι had almost forgotten, was
hateful t-“ If I may not use your advice, I shall use
the advice I can and go to any length.” You will
say : ‘⁴ You have seen him to be as you have described
him: and did you heave a sigh? '' Indeed Ι did.
You ask for the rest of our talk. What more is there
to tell? He went straight to Pedum, I to Arpinum.
From thence Ι await the “ twittering swallow '’ 1 you
talk of. You will say you prefer me not to dwell
on past mistakes. Even Pompey, our leader, has
made many.

But Ι await a letter from you. There is no room
now, as before, for your ‘⁴ await the event.'' ΤΙιε
limit we fixed was that interview; and Ι have no
doubt Ι annoyed Caesar3 so Ι must act the more
’ quickly. Please send me a letter and deal with la
haute polilique. I await a letter from you now very
anxiously.

CICERO ΤΟ ATTICUS, GREETING.

Since Rome was out of bounds, I celebrated my Arpinum,
son’s coming of age at Arpinum in preference to any March 31,
other place, and so doing delighted my fellow-towns- 13,c, 49
men. Though they were pleased, yet I must tell
you they and all others Ι have met are sad and sorry.

¹ A reference to Antholoqy x, i, ὁ πλόος ὡραῖος καὶ γὰρ λαλα-
γεῦσα χελιδὼν Ἠδη μέμβλωκεν χώ χαριεὶς Ζέφυρος.

“ Fair is the season for sailing ι already the twittering
swallow gitt‘leth amand, and soft bloweth the wind from the
west.‘’ . tt. i1‚ ’7.
