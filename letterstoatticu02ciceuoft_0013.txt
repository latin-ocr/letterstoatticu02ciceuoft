INTRODUCTION

neither Pompey nor the Senatorial party took it

’ seriously, and Caesar was forced to send an ultimatum

stating that he would resign only if Pompey did the
same. The Senate replied that, if he did not resign,
he would be declared a public enemy: and, when
their motion to that effect was vetoed by Antony
and Cassius, the latter met with the same treatment

> and had to flee to Caesar in company with Curio.

On hearing their report Caesar took the first step
in the war by crossing the Rubicon. His march
southward was so quickly executed that Pompey and

f the consuls evacuated Rome. Negotiations for peace

failed. Domitius with eighteen cohorts at Corfinium
was taken prisoner, and Pompey retreated to Brundi-
sium on his way to Greece. Hurrying after him

; Caesar blockaded the town3 but Pompey succeeded

in effecting his escape. Meantime Cicero was exhi-v

’ biting the weakest side of his character. At the

first outbreak he offered to go with Pompey3 but he
was given the command of Capua and the Campanian
coast. This command he resigned in a few days:
later he set out to join Pompey at Brundisium, but
retreated for fear of capture; and thereafter for
months he remained at Formiae shilly-shallying and
writing querulous letters to Atticus for advice. How-
ever, when he met Caesar on his return from Brun-
disium to Rome, he had sufficient courage to refuse
to take a seat in the House and support his demands.

Caesar’s stay in Rome was short and marked only
by his seizure of the public treasury and the appoint-
ment of his friends Lepidus and Antony as prefect
of the city and military commander respectively.
Then he hastened to Spain, where, after nearly
meeting with a disaster, he defeated the five legions
