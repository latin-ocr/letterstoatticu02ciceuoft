love. For he has done nothing of a kind to induce
me to share his ssight. But now my old love breaks
forth: now I miss him intolerably: now books,
letters, philosophy, do not help me one whit. Day

saviour and father of Rome, to bring against her
bordes of Getae, Armenians and Colchians? Was it
sor me to bring famine on my fellow·townsmen and
devastation on Italy? In the first place Ι reflected
