LETTERS TO ATTICUS X. 8b-9

necessary to go before anything was certain. For
‚ you will have done a serious injury to our friendship
and consulted your own interest very little, if you
show that you are not following fortune (for every-
thing that has happened seems most favourable to
me and most unfavourable to Pompey), nor yet follow-
ing the right cause (for the cause was the same then,
· when you thought fit to hold aloof from it), but that
ι you have condemned some act of mine, the greatest

harm you could do me. Do not take such a step, I
¹ pray you by the right of our friendship. Finally
’ what better befits a good and peaceful man and a
loyal citizen than to keep out of civil disturbance?
Tbere are some who approved such a course, but could
not follow it because of the danger. But you may
, examine the evidence of my life and the opinion given
by my friendship 13 you will find no safer or more
μ honourable course than to keep quite clear of the
quarrel.

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

¹ The arrival of Philotimus (what a fellow he is! how Cumae,
« stupid! how often he lies on Pompey’s behalf!) has May 3,
Ἰ frightened the rest of us to death. For myself Ι am 13.C. 49
⁷ hardened. None of us doubted that Caesar had
checked Pompey's progress: Philotimus says he is
simply flying. Nobody doubted that Petreius had

joined Afranius: he brin s no such news. In fact

* we have all been sure that ompey had actually made

¹ i.e. my decision to let you be neutral. It may, however,
mean‘ ‘Your conviction of my friendshi 1.'’p
