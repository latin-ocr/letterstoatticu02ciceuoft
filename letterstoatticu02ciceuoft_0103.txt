LETTERS TO ATTICUS VII. 21

when Caesar is at hand, and our leader is nowhere to
be found and takes no action. No one enlists. It is
not good will that is lacking, but hope. What an
inconceivable plight is Pompey’s, and how utterly
he has broken down! He has neither spirit nor
plan, nor forces, nor energy. I say nothing of his
most disgraceful ssight from the city, his timorous
speeches in the towns, his ignorance not only of the
strength of his opponent but of his own forces: but
what of this? On the 7 th of February C. Cassius the
tribune came to Capua, and brought an order to the
consuls to come to Rome, carry off the money from
the reserve treasury ¹ and leave at once. On quitting
the city they are to return—but they have no escort:
then there is the getting out of the city—who is
{⁰ng to give them leave? Lentulus replied that

ompey must first come to Picenum. No one except

but that Caesar is on the point of entering Apulia
and that Pompey is on board ship.

What Ι am to do is a big problem. It would be
no problem for me at all, if everything had not been
disgracefully managed 3 and I had no part in the plan:
still my proper course is a problem. Caesar himself
invites to peace: but the letter is dated before he
began to run amuck. Dolabella and Caelius declare
that he is well satisfied with me. I am at my wits'

² This reserve fund was said to have been founded origin·
ally to meet a possible invasion of the Gaul& It was made
up from spoils in war and from the 5 per cent. tax on
manumitted slaves. It was drawn upon in the second Punic
War (cf. Livy xxva, ll). Caesar (Bellum Oiv. 14) says the
consuls intended to open it before they left, Rome3 but fied
in haste at a report of his approach.
