LETI’ERS TO ATTICUS VII. 17

flight from Italy seemed likely. For I myself should
have gone to Spain, but it would not have been so
suitable for them. I fancy you and Sextus may well
stay in Rome even now; for you are not in the least
bound to be Pompey's friends: no one has ever
depreciated city property so much as Pompey. I
must have my joke still, you see.

You should know already the reply that Pompey
is sending by Lucius Caesar, and the nature of his
letter to Caesar; for it was written and sent on

who, though a clear writer himself, gave Sestius the
, task of drawing up documents of such importance,
which were to come into every one’s hands. Accord-

style.1 Still it is plain from the letter that nothing

his demands are to be granted. He will be utterly
mad to reject the terms, particularly when his de-
mands are most impudent. Pray, who are you, Caesar,
to insist “ Provided Pompey go to Spain, provided he
dismiss his garrisons '’? Still the demand is being
granted, but it has cost us more loss of dignity now
that he has outraged the sanctity of the state and
waged war against it, than if he had obtained his
previous request to be admitted a candidate. And

trusted his ultimatum to L. Caesar, he should have
kept a little quiet until he received a reply. But
he is said now to be more energetic than ever.
Trebatius indeed writes to me that Caesar re-
