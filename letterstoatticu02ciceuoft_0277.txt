LETTERS TO ATTICUS IX. 15—16

Brundisium on the l7th of March: that Caesar on
the next day entered the town, made a speech and
went off at full speed to Rome, meaning to be at the
city before the lst of April, to remain there a few
days and then to set out for Spain. It seemed
proper since we had sure news of Caesar’s approach
to send your servants back to you to give informa-
tion as early as possible. Your charges have our
attention, and we will act as circumstances demand.
Trebatius is trying hard to reach you before Caesar.

“ When this letter had been written, news came to
us that Caesar would stop on the 25th at Bene-
ventum, at Capua on the 26th‚ on the 27th at
Sinuessa. This we consider certain.''

me a letter dated the 26th, in which he looks forward

“ my help.'' I had written praising to the skies his
kindneSS, his clemency at Corfinium. He replied as
follows:

“ You are right to infer of me (for I am well known
to you) that there is nothing further from my nature
than cruelty. Whilst Ι take great pleasure from that
fact, Ι am proud indeed that my action wins your
approval. I am not moved because it is said that
