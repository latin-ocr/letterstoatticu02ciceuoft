ι CICERO To ATTICUS, GREETING.

On the third of April coming to my brother’s Laterium,
house at Laterium, I got your letter with some little April 3,
relief, a thing which had not happened to me since B.C. 49
this disaster began. For Ι attach very great weight

the approval of my friend Sextus, I am as glad as if
I fancied myself to have won the approval of his
father, on whose judgement I always set the very
highest value. I often call to mind how it was he
’ who said to me on that famous December the 5th,
when Ι asked him what we were to do next: ‘⁴ Let

daring live in fame for aye.'' So his influence mad xxii. 304
lives for me, and his son, who is very like him, has
the same weight as he. Please give him my best
compliments.

Your plan, it is true, you postpone for a very short
time,——for I fancy by now that that venal peace-

thing must have been done in the session of Senators‚
for I don’t consider it a Senate,—still you keep
