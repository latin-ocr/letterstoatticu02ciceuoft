CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

After I sent you my letter, I got one from Pompey. Formiae,
The rest of it was about what has happened in Feb. 16, B.C.
Picenum, as reported to him by Vibullius in a note, 49
and about Domitius' levy. That you know already:
but in this letter things were not so grand as in
Philotimus' letter. I would have sent you Pompey's
note itself‚ but my brother’s man set out in a hurry,
so I will send it to-morrow. Pompey added a P.S.
in his own hand, “I think you should come to Luceria.
You won't be safer anywhere else.'’ I understood
him to mean that he counts as lost the towns here and
the coast. Ι don't wonder that a man who has given up
the head should throw away the limbs. I sent a reply
by return, by the hands of a sure messenger‚ that I
was not concerned about where Ι should be safest,
and that I would come to Luceria immediately, if ’
his or the public interest demanded it. I entreated “
him to hold the coast, if he wanted supplies of corn
from the provinces. I saw I was writing in vain:
but I wanted to put on record now my opinion about
not abandoning Italy, as I had done before about
holding Rome. Evidently all forces are to be col-
lected at Luceria, and not even there as a permanent
base, but as a starting point for ssight, if hard pressed.
