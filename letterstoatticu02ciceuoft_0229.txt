LETTERS TO ATTICUS IX. 7b—7c

do not know3 but one thing Ι do know, that, in
sending what Ι arn sending to you, Ι am actuated by
more than ordinary affection and goodwill. 'I'liough I
am ready to die for Caesar’s sake, there are few that
I esteem as highly as I esteem you. When you have
made up your mind on the point, I should like you to
let me know, for I am much concerned that you
should be able to show your goodwill to both parties,
as you desire: and I have not the faintest doubt that
you will. Take care of your health.

CAESAR ΤΟ OPPIUS AND CORNELIUS, GREETING.

I am very glad to hear from your letters how On the road.
strongly you approve of what happened at Corfinium. shortly be·
1 shall follow your advice with pleasure—with all the fore 7 Β.
more pleasure, because I had myself made up my mind
to act with the greatest moderation, and to do my
best to effect a reconciliation with Pompey. Let us
see if by moderation we can win all hearts and secure
a lasting victory, since by cruelty others have been
unable to escape from hatred and to maintain their
victory for any length of time except L. Sulla, whose
example I do not intend to follow. This is a new
way of conquering‚ to strengthen one’s position by
kindness and generosity. As to how this can be
done, some ideas have occurred to me and many
more can be found. I should like you to turn some
attention to the matter.

I have taken N. Magius, a praefeci: of Pompey. Of
course I kept to my policy and set him free at once.
