 

LETTERS TO ATTICUS VIII. 11

, Italy under arms, and to gather a huge army. A
sort of Sulla's reign has long been his object, and is
the desire of many of his companions. Or do you
think that no agreement, no compromise between
him and Caesar was possible? Why, it is possible
to-day: but neither of them looks to our happiness.
Both want to be kings.

At your requestIhave given an outline of my views;
for you wanted an expression of my opinion on these
troubles. So I play the prophet, my dear Atticus,
not at random like Cassandra whom no one believed,
but with imaginative insight. “ Now on the great
sea '' my prophecy runs like the old tag: such an
Iliad of woe hangs over us. The case of us, who stay
at home, is worse than that of those who have gone
with Pompey, for they have only one to fear, while we
have both. You ask then, why I stay. Well, in
compliance with your request, or because I could not
meet Pompey on his departure, or because it was the
more honourable course. I say you will see poor Italy
trodden down next summer or in the hands of their
slaves drawn from every quarter of the globe. It will
not be a proscription (in spite of the talk and threats
we hear of at Luceria) which we shall have to dread,
but general destruction. So huge are the forces that
will join in the struggle. That is my prophecy.
· Perhaps you looked for consolation. I see none:

, we have reached the limit of misery, ruin and

, disgrace.

You inquire what Caesar said in his letter. The
usual thing, that my inaction pleases him, and he begs
me to maintain it. Balbus the younger brought the
same message by word of mouth. Balbus was· travel-
ling to Lentulus the consul with letters from Caesar,
