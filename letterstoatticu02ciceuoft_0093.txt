LETTERS TO ATTICUS VII. 17

quested him on the 22nd of J anuary to write and beg
me to remain near the city3 that would win me his
best thanks. All this at great length. Ι calculated
from the date, that as soon as he heard of my depar-
ture Caesar began to be concerned lest we should all
go from town. So Ι have no doubt he wrote to Piso
and to Servius. One thing surprises me, that he did
not write to me himself, or approach me through
Dolabella or Caelius. However, I am not offended
at a letter from Trebatius, who is my particular well-
wisher. I would not reply to Caesar himself, as he
had not written to me ; but Ι wrote to Trebatius how
difficult such a course would be at this juncture, but
that I was staying on my country estates, and had not
undertaken any part in the levy or any business. To
this I will stand so long as there is any prospect of
peace3 but, if it comes to war, I shall act as becomes
my duty and rank, after stowing away my boys to
Greece. For all Italy, Ι gather‚ will blaze with war.
Such a catastrophe is caused partly by disloyalty,
partly by Jealousy amongst her citizens. The out-
come will be known in a few days from Caesar's

answer to our letter. Then, isit be war, I will write

again: if it be peace or a respite, I shall hope to
see you.

On the 2nd of February, the date of this letter, I

ἰ await my women—folk in my place at Formiae, whence
ξ I have returned from Capua. Ι wrote to them on your
¹ advice to stay in Rome. But I hear that panic has

rather increased there. I want to be at Capua on
the 5th of February, as the consuls have ordered.
Any news we get here from Pompey I will let you
know at once, and I shall look to letters from you
for news from the city.
