LETTERS TO ATTICUS VII. 4-5

my arrival, encouraged me about my triumph,
promised to do his part, warned me not to enter the
House till my business was finished, for fear Ι should
make an enemy of some tribune by the opinions I ex-
pressed. In short, promises could go no further. As
to the political situation, he hinted certain war,
without hope of agreement. It appeared that,
though he had long understood there was a split
between himself and Caesar, he had had very recent
proof of it. Hirtius, a very intimate friend of Caesar 's‚
had come and had not called on Pompey. Besides
Hirtius had arrived on the evening of the 6th of
December and Balbus had arranged a meeting with
Pompey’s father-in-law before daybreak on the 7th
to discuss affairs, when, lo, late on the night before,
Hirtius set out to go to Caesar. This seemed to
⁴ Pompey proof positive of a split. In a word I have
no consolation except the thought, that, when even
his enemies have renewed his term of office and for-
tune has bestowed on him supreme power, Caesar

⁸ will not be so mad as to jeopardize these advantages.
ᾗ If he begins to run amuck, my fears are more than I
can commit to paper. As things are, I meditate a

visit to town on the 3rd of J anuary.

and I suppose Pilia’s attack of the same complaint
