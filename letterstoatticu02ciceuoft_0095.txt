CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

On the 2nd of February my women-folk came to Formiae,
formiae and brought me an account of your very Feb. 3,
kind and zealous attentionS. Ι wished them to stay B,c, 49

with its horrors. I and my brother start for Capua
on the 3rd of February, the date of this letter, to
meet the consuls on the 5th according to their
instructions.

Pompey's reply to Caesar is said to please the
people, and to have won the approval of a public
meeting. I expected it. If Caesar rejects this con—

. You

will ask my choice in the matter. Ι would answer, if

 

s I knew our state of preparation. It is reported here

that Cassius has been driven from Ancona, and that
our party hold the town. That will be a useful thing
in the event of war. As for Caesar, though he has
sent L. Caesar with negotiations for peace, neverthe-
less reports declare that he is collecting levies with
the greatest energy, seizing posts, and securing the
country with garrisons. What a villain robber ἔ What
a disgrace to the country, too dear a price to pay for
any peace! But let us restrain our anger, yield to
circumstance and accompany Pompey to Spain.
That is my choice in our straits, since we did not take
the chance when we had it of keeping him from his
second consulship} But enough of politics.

¹ Or “ since we refused him his second consulship, when
we had no choice in the matter.''
