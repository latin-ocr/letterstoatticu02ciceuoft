LETTERS TO ATTICUS IX. 9

may be harassed, but do you suppose there is any
part of Greece that will not be robbed? Pompey
openly declares and shows his men that he will be
more liberal even than Caesar in largesse. You
do well to advise me, when Ι see Caesar, not to be
too complacent, and to speak rather with dignity.
Clearly I must do so. I am thinking of going to
Arpinum after I have met him3 for I do not want to
be absent on his arrival, or to have to travel to and
fro in the wretched condition of the roads. I hear,
as you write, that Bibulus came and went back on
the l4th.

You say in your third letter that you were await-

That was why my reply to your letter, which I wrote
immediately, was late in reaching you. I think you
are right about Domitius, that he is in his place at
Cosa3 but what his plan is, is not known. That dis-
graceful mean blackguard M. Lepidus, who says that
the consular elections may be held by a praetor, is
playing his old part in politicS. So that was the
meaning of the passage in Caesar’s letter of which Ι
sent you a copy, that he wanted to enjoy my
“ advice '’ (well, that is a general expression), my
“ influence ’' (that is flattery, but Ι suppose he affects
to want it with a view to the votes of certain
senators), my ‘⁴ position ’' (perhaps he means my
vote as an ex-consul). His last phrase is ‘⁴ help in
every way.” I have begun to suspect from your
letter that that is the point, or something very like
it. For it is highly important to him that there
should not be an interregnum. That point is attained,
if consuls are created by a praetor. But in our state
books it is set down that it is illegal not only for
