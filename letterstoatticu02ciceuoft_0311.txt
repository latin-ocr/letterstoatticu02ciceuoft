 

LETTERS TO A'ITICUS X. 5-6

ξ’ἷ, shall be guilty of no omission and would that you—.
{32 But Ι will not be too troublesome. The letter Ι
{j forwarded at once to Vestorius3 he kept asking
,ἶς’ why it was not sent. Vettienus has spoken with
ἶ you in a tone more accommodating than his letter to
ἓ me: but I am greatly astonished at the man's care-
lessness. Philotimus informed me that he could buy
’,μ’ that lodge of Canuleius for 400 guineas, and could 50›000 sesterces
5 get it even for less, if I asked Vettienus to act as
purchaser. So I did ask Vettienus to get a deduc-
tion from that sum, if he could. He promised.
Lately he has informed me that he bought it for
about 3250, and asked me to inform him to whom 30‚000 sesterces
I wished to convey it, adding that the day for pay-
ment was the 13th of November. My reply was
somewhat cross, but yet in a familiar joking vein.
Now, as he is acting handsomely, I have no charge

, happen in Spain, I have made up my mind to go. M y ss.c. 49
plans have all been unfolded to you in previous
letters3 so this is a short one3 also because Ι am in a
hurry and rather busy.

As for young Quintus ‘⁸ surely Ι do my best,’' ¹ you

nihil praetermitto, consuefaeio.” ’
