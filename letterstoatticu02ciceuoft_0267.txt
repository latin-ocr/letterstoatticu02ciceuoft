LETTERS TO ATTICUS IX. 13—13a

< wretched, but nothing more wretched than this.
Pompey sent N. Magius to speak of peace, and yet
he is under siege. I did not believe it; but I have a
letter from Balbus of which Ι send you a copy. Read
it, please‚ and that clause at the end which contains
3 the remarks of the good Balbus himself, to whom
= Pompey gave a site for his estate and whom he had
, often preferred to all of us. So he is in an agony of
grief. But, that you may not have to read the same
twice over, I refer you to the letter. Of peace I
have no hope. Dolabella in his letter of the 13th of
March speaks of war pure and simple. So let us
stick to the same opinion, that there is no hope, for
nothing can be worse than all this.

BALBUS TO CICERO THE 1MPERATOR, GREETING.

Caesar has sent me a very short letter of which I Rome, about
subjoin a copy. From the shortness of the letter March 23,
you can infer that he is greatly occupied, to write so 13.c. 49
briefly about a matter of such importance. If there
is any further news, I will write you immediately.

“ CAESAR 'ro oppms, conNssLms, Gnnn'rmo.

“ On the 9th of March I came to Brundisium, and
under its walls pitched my camp. Pompey is at
Brundisium. He sent N. Magius to me to talk of
peace. I replied as I thought fit. I wanted you
to know this at once. When I have hopes of settled
terms, I will inform you immediately.’'

My dear Cicero, you can imagine my torture, after
I again had hopes of peace, for sear anything should
prevent an arrangement. I long for peace. It is all
Ι can do in my absence from the scene of action.
