 

LETTERS TO ATTICUS X. 1

iniquities are being prepared and meditated. some
now and some in the future? I shall certainly neg-
lect the law of Solon, your countryman, and I imagine
mine too soon, who provided the death penalty for
anyone who should not take one side in a revolution,
and, unless you advise otherwise, Ι shall keep apart
both from Caesar and Pompey. The former course
is quite certain: but I shall not forestall events. I
shall await your advice and the letter which I asked
you to give to Cephalio—unless you have now sent
another.

You write, not on the authority of anyone, but as
your own idea, that I shall be drawn into any negotia—
tions there may be for peace. Ι cannot imagine
that there can be such negotiations, since it is
Caesar's positive determination to rob Pompey, if
possible, of army and province, unless perhaps that
hireling can induce him to keep quiet, pending the
passage to and fro of intermediaries. Ι see nothing
that I can hope for or even imagine is likely to

’ happen. However this is the very question for an
, honest man to decide and one of the great questions

of la haute politique, whether one may enter the
council of a tyrant, if the subject of debate is good.

3 Therefore, if anything should happen to cause me to
, be summoned—I don’t in the least expect anything

will, for 1 have said all I can say about peace, and

- Caesar was determined to repudiate it-still‚ if any-
3 thing should happen, write and tell me what you

think I should do in any case. For so far nothing

’ has happened that demands greater deliberation.

I am glad you are pleased with the words of that

Ἰ loyal citizen Trebatius, and your frequent bravos

have so far been my sole pleasure. Your letter I
