LETTERS TO ATTICUS VII. 9

ported while he keeps his army. But for us some
think that nothing could be worse than Caesar in
office. You may say, “ Better so, than with an army.”
Certainly: but Pompey thinks that very ‘⁴ so '’ fatal,
and there is no remedy for it. “ We must submit to
Caesar’s will.'’ But imagine him in office again aster
your experience of his former tenure. You will reflect
that, weak as he was, he was too strong for the con-
stitution. What about him now? And now, if
Caesar is consul, Pompey will remain in Spain. What
’ a plight ! since the worst of all is the very alternative
which we cannot refuse him, and the one which, if he
takes it, will of itself win him the favour of the right
party. This course it is said he will not accept 3 let us
put it out of court. Which is the worst of the remain-
ing alternatives? To concede his impertinent de-
mand, as Pompey terms it? Impertinent it is indeed.
'You have had a province for ten years, not allotted by
the Senate‚ but by yourself through force and insubor·
'dination This term, not a legal term, but a term
j :of your own will and pleasure—-or say, this legal
! ''term—comes to an end. The House passes a decree
l ‘for the appointment of a successor. You object and
cry, ‘⁴ Consider my candidature.'' Consider our case.
&Are you to dare the House and keep your army
*longer than the nation sanctiens? “ You must fight
or yield.’' Then as Pompey sayS, let us hope for
victory, or death with freedom. If we must fight,
the time depends on chance, the plan of campaign on
circumstances So I do not trouble you on that
point. But make any suggestion you can on my
remarks. Day and night 1 am tormented.
