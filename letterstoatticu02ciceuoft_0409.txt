LETTERS TO ATTICUS XI. 13

harshly about me to many people, and so he is sorry
that he hurt your feelings: but he was right in what

ζ 116 did. Then he explains with the greatest coarse-
ζ 11655 why he did it. But he would never have shown

his hatred for me either now or before, if 116 had not

¹ seen that everything was against me. How Ι wish I

had got nearer to you, even by night-journeys as you
suggested. Now I cannot conceive where or when I

’ shall see you.

As to my co-heirs in Fufidius' property, there was
no reason for you to write to me: for their demand
is quite just, and anything you did I should think
right. As to the repurchase of the estate at Frusino,
you know already what I wish. Though my affairs
were then in a better position, and I did not expect
to be in such desperate straits, still my mind has
not altered. How it is to be done, you will arrange.

⁴ And please consider to the best of your ability some

way of obtaining ready money for current expenses.
All the money Ι had I handed over to Pompey at a

¹ time when it seemed advisable to do so. So then I
1 took money from your steward and borrowed from
¹ others, and now Quintus complains by letter that I

did not give him a penny, when he never asked for

= it and I never set eyes on the money myself. But
f please see what can be managed and what advice you
ζ have to give me on all points: you know all about it.

Grief prevents me from writing more. If there is
anything you think should be written to anyone in

³ my name, please do so as usua13 and as often as you

 

have anyone to whom you can give a letter to me,
don’t forget it. Farewell.
