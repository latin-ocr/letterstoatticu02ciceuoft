LE'ITERS TO A'ITICUS IX. 5

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

On your birthday you wrote me a letter full of Formiae,
advice, full of great kindness and of great wisdom. March 10,
Philotimus delivered it to me the day after he got it ιη, 49
from you. ΤΙιε points you discuss are very difficult
—the route to the upper sea, a voyage by the lower

gratulate him; but the most miserable thing of all
will be to see what I tell you must very shortly be
seen.

Curtius Postumus was with me. I wrote you how
tiresome he was. Quintus Fufius also came to see
me—what an air! what assurancel—hastening to
Brundisium denouncing Pompey’s wrong-doings and
the careless folly of the House. When Ι cannot
stand this under my own roof, how shall I be able to
endure Curtius in the Senate? But suppose I put
up with all this in good humour, what of the ques-
tion “ Your vote, M. Tullius? '³ What will come of
it? Ι pass over the cause of the Republic, which I
consider lost, both from the wounds dealt it and the
cures prepared for them3 but what am I to do about
Pompey? It is no use denying that I am downright
angry with him. For I am always more affected by
the causes of events than by the events themselves.
Tberefore considering our incomparable woes‚ or
rather concluding that they have happened by his
doing and his mistakes‚ 1 am more angry with Pom-
pey than with Caesar himself. Just as our ancestors
