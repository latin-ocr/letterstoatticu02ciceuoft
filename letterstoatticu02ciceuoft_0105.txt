guard against events as much as possible. Ι have
nothing to say in such an anxious crisis: but I arn
looking for your letter.

CICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.

I see there is not a foot of ground in Italy Formiae, the
which is not in Caesar’s power. Ι have no news of evening Qf

Pompey, and I imagine he will be captured unless he Feb· ,8 01‘
has taken to the sea. What marvellous dispatch! ssogmng qs
While our leader— ε but it grieves me to blame him, as 45 ⁶ 9' Μ’
Ι am in an agony of suspense on his account. There
is reason for you to fear butchery‚ not that anything
could be less advantageous to secure Caesar a lasting
victory and power; but Ι see on whose advice he
will act. Ι hope it will be all right; and Ι think we
shall have to yield. As regards the Oppii I have no
suggestion to make. Do what you think best. You
should speak with Philotimus, and besides you will
have Terentia on the 13th. What can Ι (1οὲ In
what land or on what sea can I follow a man, when I
don't know where he is? After all how can I follow
on land, and by sea whither? Shall Ι then surrender
to Caesar? Suppose Ι could surrender with safety,
as many advise, could I surrender with honour? By
no means. Ι will ask your advice as usual. The pro—
blem is insoluble. Still, if anything comes into your
head, please write3 and let me know what you will
do yourself.
